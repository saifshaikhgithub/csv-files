Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. Since both these writ applications are interconnected; as such, the same are being disposed of by this common order. [xfed] [xfed] 2. W.P. (S) No. 136 of 2016 has been preferred by the petitioner for quashing the office order as contained in memo no.4532 dated 29.10.2015, passed by the District Superintendent of Education, Dhanbad (Respondent No.4), whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service with retrospective effect i.e. 21.10.2008, after the petitioner stood retired on 30.04.15 from the post of2Assistant Teacher and also for payment of all consequential benefits after quashing the impugned order. [xfed] [xfed] 3. W.P.(S) No. 4669 of 2015 has been preferred by the petitioner for direction upon the respondent Authorities to pay all pensionary benefits including pension, gratuity, leave encashment, provident fund and other admissible outstanding dues on account of retirement of the petitioner on 30.04.2015 from the post of Assistant Teacher, Middle School, Ratanpur, Govindpur-02, Dhanbad and also to pay the salary after deducting the subsistence allowance from 24.11.2008 to 30.04.2015 inasmuch as, the petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008 and retired on 30.04.2015 without conclusion of the departmental proceeding. [xfed] [xfed] 4. Brief factual matrix relevant for disposal of the matter as disclosed in the writ applications are that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher on 20.04.1977. In the year 1995, a case was instituted against him being Govindpur (Barwadda) P.S. Case No.355 of 1992, registered underSections 302/307/149and341of the Indian Penal Code in which he was convicted on 14.10.2008 and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life on 21.10.2008. However, he was released on bail by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2014 passed in Criminal Appeal No.03 of 2009 filed by the petitioner, which is still pending before this Court. The petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008 (Annexure-1) and a departmental proceeding was initiated against him by framing memo of charge on 31.03.2015 (Annexure-2) and he was directed to submit his reply to the memo of charge on 08.04.2015 (Annexure-3). Thereafter, on 11.04.2015, the petitioner responded to the letter dated 08.04.2015 and submitted his reply to the memo of charge on 21.04.2015 (Annexure-5). During pendency of the proceeding, the petitioner retired from service on 30.04.2015 while he was3posted as Assistant Teacher, Middle School, Ratanpur, Govindpur-02, Dhanbad. On 27.05.2015 (Annexure-6), the petitioner submitted all the relevant papers for payment of his pensionary benefits, but however, with no effect. The specific case of the petitioner is that he has been dismissed from service retrospectively w.e.f. 21.10.2008 i.e. the date of sentence after conviction, by the impugned office order dated 29.10.2015 (Annexure-7). [xfed] [xfed] 5. Mr. Manoj Tandon, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the office order dated 29.10.2015 passed by the Respondent No.4 whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from his services with retrospective effect is totally against the settled principle of law as dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. Learned counsel further contended that since the petitioner has been superannuated on 30.04.2015 and he was dismissed from his services on 29.10.2015 as such, the petitioner is entitled to get all the consequential/retiral benefits payable to him. He further contended that an act done by the petitioner in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude. He further contended that retiral benefit cannot be withheld under Rule 43 of the Bihar Pension Rules, as Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules specifically provides the right of withholding or withdrawing any pension or any part of it, if a pecuniary loss has been caused to the Government and it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue a show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex-employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules. He further contended that the petitioner could not have been dismissed as the same is barred underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel concluded his argument by submitting that continuation of departmental proceeding and order of punishment after superannuation of the petitioner is wholly unjustified and against the provisions4of law. In order to buttress his argument, learned counsel relied on the following judgments: [xfed] [xfed] (a)Chandra Singh and others v. State of Rajasthan and anotherreported in (2003) 6 SCC 545 (para-38); [xfed] (b) Dev Prakash Tewari v. U.P. Cooperative Institutional Service Board reported in (2014)7 SCC 260 (Para-8, 9 & 10); [xfed] [xfed] (c)Bhagirathi Jena v. Board of Directors OSFC & ors. reported in (1999)3 SCC 666 (Para-6 & 7) Learned Counsel also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Patna High Court reported in 2007 (1) PLJR 289 [Suresh Kumar v. Union of India & Ors.] wherein the Court held that any dismissal will be bad in law during the pendency of the appeal. Relying on the aforesaid judgments, Mr. Tandon submits that the impugned order deserves to be quashed and set-aside. [xfed] [xfed] 6. Per Contra, Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, GP-V, appearing on behalf of the Respondents contended that the order of dismissal dated 29.10.2015 passed by Respondent no. No.4 is not bad in law as the petitioner has been convicted for committing an offence undersection 302/149of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs.1000/- on 21.10.2008. He contended that the issue involved in this case is well settled that if an employee is convicted for a serious offence involving moral turpitude then only on that ground, the employee can be dismissed from his/her service. He further submits that the moment he was convicted, he seizes to become a public servant. He further submits that the full bench of the Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Sarju Prasad Singh v The State of Bihar& Ors. reported in (1986) PLJR 285, the Hon'ble Court has held that the criminal charge of substantive murder undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code involves moral turpitude. It has been further submitted by the learned counsel for the State respondents that5though the petitioner was convicted for the offence undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code on 21.10.2008, but the petitioner has never informed the Respondent Authorities or the school where he was Assistant Teacher regarding such conviction and this fact will be evident from Annexure-1 of the writ petition which is the suspension letter issued by the Respondent No.4 dated 24.11.2008. In the said letter it has been mentioned that on the basis of the letter written by the petitioner and the letter issued by Area Education Officer, Govindpur, it has been brought to the notice of the Respondent No.4 that the petitioner has been made an accused in connection with Barwadda P.S. Case No.413 of 1995 for which he remained in custody and as such, the petitioner has been suspended. This very letter clearly indicates the fact that the Respondent No.4 was not aware of the conviction of the petitioner dated 21.10.2008 and the authorities came to know about such conviction only in the year 2015, which will be evident from Annexure-3 of the Writ Petition. [xfed] [xfed] 7. It is next submitted by the Respondents that the petitioner has not annexed any letter to show that the petitioner has superannuated on 30.04.2015 rather a statement has been made in paragraph-13 of the Writ Petition that the petitioner has retired on 30.04.2015. It is further relevant to mention here that a Departmental Proceedings was initiated against the petitioner on 31.03.2015 and Memo of Charge was also served upon the petitioner and thereafter an inquiry officer was appointed on 08.04.2015 and the petitioner filed his written statement of defence on 21.04.2015 and the order of dismissal was passed on 29.10.2015 and even in the order of dismissal it has not been mentioned that the petitioner has superannuated on 30.04.2015; as such, the contention of the petitioner that the petitioner has retired from service on 30.04.2015 cannot be accepted as there is no document that has been annexed by the petitioner to prove the same.6 [xfed] 8. It is further contended by the Respondents that once an employee is convicted of a serious offence involving moral turpitude then it permits the disciplinary authority to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the employee and ought to take appropriate steps to his/her dismissal/removal only on the basis of such conviction. [xfed] [xfed] 9. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the Respondents rely on the following judgments:- [xfed] a. (2010) 8 SCC 573 [in the case of Sushil Kumar Singhal v Regional Manager PNB (Paragraphs-18, 21 & 24)]; [xfed] b. (1996) 4 SCC 17 [in the case of Pawan Kumar v State of Haryana & another]; [xfed] c. (1997) 4 SCC 1 [in the case of Allahabad Bank & another v Deepak Kumar Bhola]; [xfed] d. 2013 (3) PLJR 608 [in the case of Subrata Basu v State of Bihar & Ors.]. [xfed] 10. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on record, following issues emerge for adjudication:- [xfed] Issue no. (i) Whether continuation of departmental proceeding and order of punishment even after superannuation of the delinquent is justified? [xfed] Issue no. (ii) Whether the petitioner is entitled/covered by the protection guaranteed underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India? [xfed] Issue no. (iii) Whether after conviction for an offence involving moral turpitude it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue any show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex-employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules? [xfed] Issue no. (iv) Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the dismissal of the petitioner retrospectively w.e.f. the date of conviction by competent Court is justified ? [xfed] 11. It appears that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher on 20.04.1977 and in the year 1995, a criminal case has been instituted against him for the offence committed underSections 302/307/149and341of the Indian Penal Code and in the said criminal proceedings he was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life. Thereafter, the petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008. The fact further transpires that the petitioner was released on bail by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2014 in Criminal Appeal No.03 of 2009. A departmental proceeding was also initiated against the petitioner in which he was dismissed from service retrospectively w.e.f. 21.10.2008 by the impugned office order dated 29.10.2015 (Annexure-7). [xfed] 12. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that continuation of departmental proceedings and order of punishment after his superannuation is wholly unjustified and against the provisions of law and the question of imposing major penalty of dismissal after his superannuation would not arise. In this regard reference may be made to the Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case ofTakhatray Shivadattaray Mankad V. State of Gujaratreported in 1989 Supp (2) SCC 110. In the said case the question of departmental inquiry instituted before retirement and its continuation after the age of superannuation was considered. It was held that proceedings could be continued under the relevant rules, and as provided, the order could have been passed with respect to pension and gratuity. The proceedings did not become infructuous. Recently also, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited -versus- Rabindranath Choubey reported in 2020 SCC online SC 470 has held that the disciplinary authority has powers to impose penalty of dismissal upon the delinquent even after his attaining the age of superannuation. Relevant portion of Para-70 & 72 are quoted herein below:- [xfed] [xfed] ""70. .......................... It would be against the public policy to permit an employee to go scot-free after collecting various service benefits to which he would not be entitled, and the event of superannuation cannot come to his rescue and would amount to condonation of guilt. Because of the legal fiction provided under the rules, it can be completed in the same manner as if the employee had remained in service after superannuation, and appropriate punishment can be imposed."" [xfed] ""72. .................................................................. (2) the disciplinary authority has powers to impose the penalty of dismissal/major penalty upon the respondent even after his attaining the age of superannuation, as the disciplinary proceedings were initiated while the employee was in service."" [xfed] 13. The aforesaid judgment has clearly laid down the legal position that the departmental proceedings do not lapse and become infructuous and punishment, as may be considered appropriate, can be imposed in terms of relevant rules. As such the issue no.(1) is decided against the petitioner. [xfed] [xfed] 14. It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner could not have been dismissed as the same is barred underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. This aspect has been dealt by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Deputy Director of Collegiate Education (Administration) Madras v S Nagoor Meera reported in AIR 1995 SC 1364 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down the law in paragraph-9 as under:- [xfed] [xfed] ""The Tribunal seems to be of the opinion that until the appeal against the conviction is disposed of action under clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)is not permissible. We see no basis or justification for the said view. The more appropriate course in all such cases is to take action under Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)once a government servant is convicted of a criminal charge and not to wait for the appeal or revision, as the case may be. If, however, the government servant- accused is acquitted on appeal or other proceeding, the order can always be revised and if the government servant is reinstated, he will be entitled to all the benefits to which9he would have been entitled to had he continued in service. The other course suggested, viz., to wait till the appeal, revision and other remedies are over, would not be advisable since it would mean continuing in service a person who has been convicted of a serious offence by a criminal court. It should be remembered that the action under Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)will be taken only where the conduct which has led to his conviction is such that it deserves any of the three major punishments mentioned inArticle 311(2).As held by his court in Shankardass v. Union of India [1985] 2 S.C.R. 358: [xfed] Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution confers on the government the power to dismiss a person from service ""on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge"". But that power like every other power has to be exercised fairly, justly and reasonably. Surely, the Constitution does not contemplated that a government servant who is convicted for parking his scooter in a no-parking area should be dismissed from service. He may perhaps not be entitled to be heard on the question of penalty since Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)makes the provisions of that article inapplicable when a penalty is to be imposed on a Government servant on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge. But the right to impose a penalty carries with it the duty to act justly."" [xfed] 15. In the present case, admittedly, the petitioner has been convicted for the offence undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code which is a serious offence as also offence involving moral turpitude as such, the petitioner cannot claim the benefits ofArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India and further according to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Deputy Director of Collegiate Education (Administration) Madras v S Nagoor Meera (Supra), until the said conviction of the petitioner is set aside by the Appellate Court or Higher Court may not be advisable to retain such person in service and if the10petitioner succeeds in appeal on other proceedings the matter can always be reviewed in such a manner that the petitioner suffers no prejudice. In view of the aforesaid legal position, issue no.(ii) is also decided against the petitioner as the petitioner cannot claim benefits ofArticle 311(2)in view of Clause-(a) of second proviso toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. [xfed] [xfed] 16. It has also been argued by Mr. Tandon with regard to the prayer made by the petitioner that he may be granted all consequential benefits. It has been vehemently contended that retiral benefit cannot be withheld under Rule 43 of the Bihar Pension Rules as Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules specifically provides that right of withholding or withdrawing any pension or any part of it, if a pecuniary loss has been caused to the Government is found in a departmental or a judicial proceeding to have been guilty of grave misconduct ought to have caused pecuniary loss to the Government by misconduct or by negligence during his service rendered on re-employment after retirement. [xfed] [xfed] I am not in agreement with this contention of the learned counsel of the petitioner for the sole reason that Rule 43(a) of the Bihar Pension Rules clearly provides that pension can be withheld if a person has been convicted of a serious crime and in the present case, the petitioner has been convicted undersection 302of the Indian Penal code and as such, the aforesaid submission of the petitioner is totally misconceived. [xfed] [xfed] 17. It has been further contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the main question to be considered whether after such conviction it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue any show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex- employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules.11 [xfed] From perusal of the provision under Rule 43(b), it does not appear that any such procedure is required to be followed; the said Rule only consist upon a proper opportunity to an employee in a full fledged departmental proceeding before arriving at a finding of misconduct upon which order of withholding pension is made. With regard to judicial proceeding, no such procedure is required as the very functioning of a criminal court is such that maximum opportunity of hearing is provided to a person and finding of guilt is recorded if the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt. Once a finding is recorded either in a departmental or judicial proceeding, there is no further requirement in the said Rule of giving a further opportunity to the concerned employee. The same is not required even when a punishment is imposed while he is still in service after the 42nd amendment of the Constitution of India inArticle 311.If no such further opportunity to represent in the Departmental Proceeding is required. so far as the quantum of punishment is concerned or even with respect to passing an order of withholding the whole or part of the pension, then no question arises that how after conviction by a court of law, such opportunity would be required. This principle of law has been reiterated by the Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case ofChintamani Sinha & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2013 (1) PLJR 439 wherein at para-15 the law has been laid down as under:- [xfed] ""15. I have considered the submissions of learned counsels for the parties. It is evident from the facts of the present case that the original petitioner not only had been charged of having committed the criminal offence of murder while he was still in service and remained in jail continuously both at the time of trial and for almost five years after his conviction after filing Criminal Appeal in the year 2004 and he was finally released on bail by order dated 20.5.2009 of this Court. The offence of committing murder as per the Full Bench decision of this Court in Sarju Prasad Singh's case (supra) involves moral turpitude and thus conviction underSection 302IPC by itself would have been sufficient, if the said order has been passed while the petitioner was still in service, for dismissal of the petitioner from service in terms of the Service Rules as also the provisions ofArticle 311of the12Constitution without holding any further departmental enquiry against the petitioner."" [xfed] 18. Thus, issue no.(iii) is also decided against the petitioner. [xfed] 19. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that the office order dated 29.10.2015 passed by the Respondent No.4 whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from his services with retrospective effect is totally against the settled principle of law as dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. He further argued that an act done by the petitioner in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude [xfed] 20. It is well settled proposition of law that if an employee is convicted for a serious offence involving moral turpitude then only on that ground, he can be dismissed from his/her services. The moment a person is convicted, he seizes to become a public servant. A Government Servant in terms of Rule 3 of the Bihar Service Conduct Rules is required to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to duty and to do nothing which is unbecoming of a Government Servant. It was this aspect of the matter which was considered by the full bench of Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Sarju Prasad Singh v State of Bihar (Supra) wherein it has been held that a Government Servant having been convicted by a Court of competent jurisdiction for criminal charge of murder can be said to have committed an offence involving moral turpitude and as such, conduct of the Government Servant is in violation of Rule 3 of the Bihar Government Service Conduct Rules. The argument of the petitioner that an act done by a Government Servant in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude is misconceived. This submission is in teeth of the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dayashankar v High Court of Allahabad reported in AIR 1987 SC 1469 where a13Government Servant having been caught using unfair means in the examination, an act which did not relate to discharge of his official duty, was held to be conduct to totally unworthy of the office of a Government Servant. In this regard reference can also be made to the judgment passed by Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Subrata Basu reported in 2013(3) PLJR 608 wherein at para-23, the Hon'ble Court has held as under:- [xfed] [xfed] ""23. As would be noted from perusal of the aforementioned Rules, the amendment in Rule 3(A) by inserting the underlined provision was made by GSR 12 dated 8.8.1990 enabling the competent authority to place a Government servant under suspension on the ground of his facing prosecution for offence underSection 304Bof the Indian Penal Code. Such order of suspension in terms of Rule 3(A)(5) was to remain in force until it was modified or revoked by the competent authority to do so. The order of suspension of the petitioner was passed only during the pendency of his facing criminal trial for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and, therefore, the life of such suspension order had come to an end when the judgment in the criminal case convicting him for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and sentencing him to under rigorous imprisonment for life had been passed. In that view of the mater, the respondents were under obligation to consider the case of the petitioner and the competent authority having found the petitioner to have been convicted for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and other allied offences had dismissed him from service by an order dated 16.11.2001 in keeping with the requirement of proviso A toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India laying down automatic dismissal, removal or reduction in rank after conviction of a Government servant. Thus, the recourse taken to by the respondents in passing such an order on 16.11.2001 dismissing the petitioner on account of his being convicted by the competent court cannot be faulted either on fact or in law, inasmuch as, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the petitioner, a life convict for an offence underSection 304(B)IPC, could not have been allowed to continue in service."" [xfed] 21. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. In my considered opinion, in the instant case, the order of dismissal in essence is not a case of retrospective termination. The order is only ex post facto recognition of an event that has already been taken14place. The petitioner was already convicted and sentenced on 21.10.08. Recognition of event is naturally ex post facto when after release on Bail in Criminal Appeal, the petitioner represented before the respondent authorities and only then the departmental proceeding was initiated against him. Even otherwise, in the case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (Supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court has categorically held that the disciplinary authority has powers to impose the penalty of dismissal /major penalty upon the delinquent even after his attaining the age of superannuation; as such, the contention of the petitioner that the dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively is misconceived and has no force in the eye of law. In view of the aforesaid discussions even the issue no. (iv) is decided against the petitioner. [xfed] 22. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and discussions made hereinabove, I do not find any error in the impugned order as contained in memo no.4532 dated 29.10.2015 passed by the District Superintendent of Education, Dhanbad (Respondent no.4), whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service. Further, from para-10 of the counter affidavit dated 25.06.2020 filed in W.P.(S) no. 4669 of 2015, it appears that the petitioner has already received his GPF accumulation amounting to Rs.6,36,070/- and compulsory Group Insurance amount for Rs.1,62,553/- vide bill no.144/2016-17. As such, the petitioner is not entitled for any relief, whatsoever, as prayed for in the aforesaid writ applications. [xfed] 23. Consequently, both these writ applications are hereby dismissed on contest. [xfed] (Deepak Roshan, J.) The High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi Dated: 01/09/2020 /AFR/Pramanik/"

[xfed] I have heard the counsel for the petitioners in both cases and counsel for the State as well as opposite party. [xfed] 2. Since both these cases are arising out of same FIR and the prayer is common, I am disposing these two applications by a common order. [xfed] 3. These two criminal miscellaneous application has been filed by the respective petitioners praying therein to quash the FIR registered as Govindpur P.S. Case No. 484 of 2015, corresponding to G.R. No. 5840 of 2015 registered underSection 406,420,120BIPC. The case arises out of a complaint being C.P Case No. 2137 of 2015 which was referred underSection 156(3)of the Cr.P.C, by the C.J.M, for registering FIR. Thus, the instant FIR was registered. [xfed] 4. The complaint was initially lodged against Pansri Wasavi Industries limited as accused no.1, Mr. Eswara Rao Gandhi and Prashant Mohan Nayak accused nos. 2 and 3 and also against other three accused persons. The petitioner in Cr.M.P No. 451 of 2016 happens to be the accused No.3 and the petitioner in Cr.M.P No. 479 of 2016 happens to be accused no.2 and is shown to be the Managing Director of accused no.1 company. [xfed] 5. The brief facts, which give rise to the FIR, is that the complainant is a company which manufactures and deals in hard coke and pearl coke. It is alleged that the accused persons approached the complainant and expressed their intention to purchase the products which is manufactured by the complainant. Terms and-2-conditions were settled and it was agreed that prompt payment would be made by the accused persons, after the supply is made. It is alleged that the materials were supplied to the accused persons but the accused persons failed to keep up their promises and did not make payment in terms of the conditions which was agreed upon by the parties. Considerable amount became due against these supply orders. The complainant finding it difficult, stopped supplying hard coke to the accused persons. It has been stated that because of the non-payment of the due amount, the complainant started to face financial loss. It is stated that the accused persons further placed orders for supplying of pearl coke and the same was agreed to be supplied on the condition that the accused persons will issue post-dated cheques. The supply resumed and post-dated cheques were handed over. A verbal request was made by the accused persons to the effect that the cheque should not be presented for clearing and an assurance was given that the amount covered by the cheques would be given to the complainant from time to time and the post-dated cheques would be returned. It is alleged that the total outstanding amount became Rs. 145.56 lakhs. It is further stated that during transaction the accused persons started transferring money in the account of the complainant and requested to return the post-dated cheques as and when the amount was being transferred. These types of practice was adopted by the accused. It is stated that three cheques amounting to Rs. 24,26,000/- each were not deposited by the complainant in the bank as there was an assurance that the said amount would be handed over as per the usual practice but the said amount was not transmitted in the account of complainant, thus the complainant was cheated to the tune of Rs. 72.78 lakhs. He stated that the validity of the cheques in the meantime also expired. The complainant came to learn that the accused persons started purchasing coke from other parties knowing fully well that there is an outstanding amount of Rs. 72.78 lakhs against supply of coke made. The complainant stated that there were three other post-dated cheques lying with the complainant bearing Nos. 227103, 227105 and 227109 which were presented to the bank but the same got dishonoured because of insufficient funds and also because of the drawers signatures differed. It has been mentioned that original authorized signatory was Mr. M.S. Raju and Mr. Kushal Roy but the accused persons by means of a conspiracy, changed the name of the authorised signatory. It has been mentioned that on the aforesaid facts a criminal offence is made out which is punishable-3-underSections 420,406,120BIPC. Thus, the complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)for registering FIR. [xfed] 6. Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner in both cases submits that from perusal of the complaint no criminal offence is made out. He submits that what are the specific overtact, which constitutes a criminal offence against both the petitioners, has not been mentioned in the complaint petition. He submits that without there being any overtact alleged against the petitioner, these two petitioners cannot be made an accused in this case. He submits that at best an offence underSection 138NI Act is made out because of dishonour of the cheques, but in this case the complainant has filed a complain, resulting in FIR, underSection 406,420IPC which is absolutely a misuse of the process of law. He submits that admittedly there was an on-going business transactions between the parties and when there is an on-going business transactions and there arises a dispute which is infact a money claim in nature, initiation of a criminal proceeding cannot be allowed as the same amounts to abuse of process of court. He submits that FIR was instituted on the direction where the court has exercised power underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. He submits that none of the procedure laid down underSection 154Cr.P.C has been followed. There is no affidavit filed by the complainant to suggest that he had at all approached the police before filing the complaint. He submits that prayer in the complaint was either to take cognizance or to refer the matter underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. It is his contention that when the court had exercised his jurisdiction underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. it was the duty of the court to satisfy itself as to whether the pre- conditions as laid down underSection 154Cr.P.C has been complied or not. In support of submission he relied upon a case of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Anr. Vrs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287. The petitioner further submits that there was business transaction between the parties which is admitted but because of bad financials status of the company i.e accused no.1 the petitioner had to move before the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction which would be evident from Annexure-2 series. It is submitted that there was no intention to cheat the complainant as there is nothing in the entire FIR to suggest that there was an intention to cheat from the very inception of the transaction. [xfed] 7. Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no.2 submits that the petitioners had an intention to cheat. He submits that when first assurance was given that no sooner the supply is made, the amount would be paid to the complainant but the accused persons failed to honour their promise. It has been further argued that thereafter a negotiation was arrived at between the parties and it was decided that post-dated cheques would be given against supply of materials. He submits that there was an understanding that on receipt of money those post-dated cheques would be handed over back to the accused persons. He submits that three cheques got bounced for insufficiency of fund and also on the ground that the signature differed. He submits that changing the signing authorities suggest that there was a criminal intention of the accused persons. He further submits that accused persons on one hand did not pay the price of the coke which they have taken from the complainant and rather started purchasing material from other sellers which clearly suggests their criminal intention. He submits that it is well settled principle of law that when from a written report or a complaint a cognizable offence is made out, the FIR cannot be quashed. [xfed] 8. The facts giving rise to this case has already been narrated in the foregoing paragraphs of this order. What is evident from the facts is that there was business transaction between the parties. The accused company promised that the price of coke would be paid, no sooner the delivery is completed. Huge amount fell due against the supply. Thus, as per the complainant, the promise to make payment at the earliest, was not honoured by the accused. Later on a new mode of transaction was adopted, where post-dated cheques were given and on deposition of the cheque amount, the respective cheques were returned. Validity of three cheques lapsed, but the amount was not paid and in respect of other three cheques, the same were dishonoured due to insufficiency of fund in bank and also for the reason the company had charged the authorized signatory. Now the question falls for consideration is whether failure to keep promise can be an offence punishable underSections 420&406IPC. [xfed] 9. The question raised has already been answered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.W. Palanitkar & Ors. Vrs. State of Bihar & Anr. reported in (2002) 1 SCC 241 the Hon'ble Supreme court in paragraph no.21 of the aforesaid judgment has held that a mere failure to keep up promise subsequently cannot be presumed as an act leading to cheating. In this instant case, we find that there is an allegation that the accused persons and the company had promised that they would pay for the bills no sooner the same were raised but the later on, failed to keep up their promise. Thus, it is the case of the complainant that there was failure on part of the accused-company to keep the promise which it had made. It is also the case of the complainant that a huge amount remained outstanding against various supplies. It is stated that this action has caused loss to the complainant and a corresponding gain to the accused persons. A very important statement has been given in the complaint wherein the complainant has stated that on further request made by the accused persons, the complainant agreed to supply more coke on the conditions of payment of post-dated cheques. This statement clearly suggest that there was ongoing business transaction between the parties. This also suggest that there was no intention to cheat as because if there would have been any intention to cheat or the complainant if at all felt cheated, the complainant could not have been induced to sell and supply further more coke to the accused persons. Further in the complaint petition it has been stated that the supply of coke continued and the outstanding amount came to Rs. 145.56 lakhs till date and this outstanding amount is due to these transactions. It is also admitted in the complaint that the accused persons also started transferring money in the account of the complainant and requested to return the post dated cheques after the amount was transferred and this practice was adopted by the accused persons regarding the payment. These statements clearly suggest that some of the outstanding amounts were continued to be paid by this petitioner's company. Till the date the amounts were paid, there was no dispute. I find that thereafter suddenly the payment was stopped and the cheques could not be deposited by the complainant resulting in expiry of the due date of the cheques but the complainant thereafter deposited the rest three cheques which got dishonoured. [xfed] 10.Section 420of the IPC provides punishment for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. Cheating has been defined insection 415of the IPC which reads as follows:- [xfed] 415. cheating:- ""Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to ""cheat"" [xfed] Explanation.- A dishonest concealment of facts is deception within the meaning of this section."" [xfed] 11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of G.V Rao Vrs. L.H.V Prasad & Ors. reported in (2000) 3 SCC 693 has held thatsection 415has two part. While in the first part the person must dishonestly or fraudulently induce the complainant to deliver any property, in the second part the person should intentionally induce the complainant to do or omit to do a thing. That is to say, in the first part inducement must be dishonest or fraudulent. In the second part the inducement should be intentional. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held that the mens-rea on the part of the persons, must also be established. [xfed] 12. In this case, as seen above, I find that there is an allegation that the promise which was made i.e promise to pay the amount as soon as the bills were raised, was not honoured. This cannot be said to be an intention to cheat. Further from the complaint it is stated that the price was being paid time to time and the post-dated cheques were taken back but thereafter at some point this procedure and the mode which they have adopted failed or not honoured. This also strengthens the fact that there was no intention to cheat. Further it is an admitted case of the parties that the accused company was under Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and there are several orders passed by the Authority. This suggest that the financial condition of the accused company deteriorated which prevented them from making payment of the amount. [xfed] 13.Section 406IPC provides for punishment for criminal breach of trust. Criminal breach of trust is defined insection 405IPC.Section 403defines dishonest misappropriation of property. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of U. Dhar and Another Vrs. State of Jharkhand & Anr. reported in (2003) 2 SCC 219 has held thatSection 403IPC uses the word ""dishonestly"" and ""misappropriate"". These are the necessary ingredients of an offence underSection 403IPC. Applying the aforesaid provision of law and the facts of this case, I find that neither of these ingredients are satisfied in the facts and circumstances of this case. In this case I find that the transactions arose out of ongoing business transaction between the parties which continued and ultimately at a point of time the dues escalated and the accused company failed to repay the same. Mere failure to repay the dues cannot be said to be a criminal offence. [xfed] 14. I am well aware of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which has held that where civil remedy is available, arising out of disputes from a breach of contract, remedy under the criminal law is also not barred if the allegations disclosed the element of criminal offence. The Hon'ble Supreme has also in the case of Binod Kumar & Ors. Vrs. State of Bihar & Anr. reported in (2014) 10 SCC 663 has held that for mere recovery of money, criminal case should not be allowed to proceeded. In this case, the facts which has been narrated, suggest that the dispute is absolutely civil in nature and is infact a money claim. Though there is an allegation of dishonour of cheques, that would come under the provision of underSection 138NI. Act and not underSections 406and420IPC for which the accused can be proceeded against. The complainant has got different remedy under the Negotiable Instruction Act so far as allegation of dishonour of cheque is concerned which he can avail, subject to limitation, but so far as the facts are concerned, I find that there is no ingredients ofSections 406or 420IPCpresent in the entire complaint petition. As there is no ingredients ofSections 406and420IPC in the complaint in hand, I find that this case is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme court as rendered in the case of Binod Kumar & Ors. (Supra). [xfed] 15. Further I find that this case arises out of a complaint. The complainant had filed a complaint which was registered as C.P Case No. 2137 of 2015. On receipt of the said complaint the Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad had written on the margin of the complaint that the police to investigate the case as-8-per provision underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. This is the one line order which was passed by the Magistrate referring the complaint to investigate in terms ofSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Anr. (Supra) has held that there should be application of mind while passing an order underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has dealt with several judgments and has specifically laid down the law in Paragraph Nos. 20, 21 and 27 of the aforesaid judgment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paragraph No. 27 has held that the Magistrate has to remain vigilant with regard to the allegations made and the nature of allegations and not to issue directions without proper application of mind. He has also to bear in mind that sending the matter would be conducive to justice and then he may pass the requisite order. Further it has been held that the said application which has been filed underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. should be supported by an affidavit and the purpose of filing such affidavit is to prevent abuse of the process which has become more common these days. When I go through the instant case and the complaint petition I find that there is no affidavit annexed along with the said complaint petition. I find that there was no prior invocation ofSection 154(3)while filing this petition before the court underSection 156(3). Thus, this order and the action of the Magistrate, sending the complaint to the police station for investigation 156(3)Cr.P.Cand registering an FIR is not in consonance with the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this score also the order registering the FIR which has been passed by the Magistrate is also absolutely bad. [xfed] 16. Thus, in terms of what has been discussed and held above, I find merits in this application. This application therefore stands allowed and the criminal case being Govindpur P.S. Case No. 484 of 2015, corresponding to G.R. No. 5840 of 2015 is hereby quashed. [xfed] (ANANDA SEN , J) anjali/ C.P 3"
2,126409115,Prabhat Ranjan vs The State Of Jharkhand,"(Deepak Roshan, J.)","1 September, 2020",,[],-1,[],"[xfed] CAV on: 10/07/2020, Pronounced on: 01/09/2020 Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. [xfed] 2. The instant application has been preferred by the petitioner for quashing and setting aside the order dated 01.02.2012, whereby the petitioner has been awarded punishment of dismissal and also for quashing and setting aside the order dated 08.07.2011, whereby the petitioner has been awarded punishment of withholding of two increments. [xfed] [xfed] 3. At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he has been awarded two punishments; one is removal from service and the other is for withholding of 2 increments, in two separate proceeding but for the same set of charges and for similar cause of action. He further contended that the order of dismissal is for the charge that the petitioner had consummated second marriage during the existence of first marriage and the order for withholding of two increments is for the charge of not properly looking after his first wife and two children and having extra marital relationship with another lady. [xfed] [xfed] 4. The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass. The petitioner has been departmentally proceeded vide Departmental Proceeding No.30 of 2007, issued by the respondent No.3 when he was posted as police constable of STF and deputed in Sahibganj. In the said departmental proceeding, the petitioner has been dismissed from service vide order dated 01.02.2012. The petitioner was also earlier awarded punishment vide order 08.07.2011 in Departmental Proceeding No.39 of 2010, on the charge that he is not looking after his first wife and children and living with another lady having illegal relationship. [xfed] [xfed] 5. The case of the petitioner is that when the cause of action is almost same and similar, there is no ground for initiating two proceedings and awarding two different punishments. [xfed] [xfed] 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the punishment order of withholding of increments in pay was passed on 08.07.2011 in the subsequent Departmental Proceeding No.39/2010, whereas the dismissal order has been passed in the earlier proceeding on 01.02.2012 i.e. after more than 6 months from the earlier order of punishment. He further contended that the above mentioned two punishment orders is hit by the principle of double jeopardy which violates individual natural rights and also principle of civil jurisprudence. [xfed] [xfed] 7. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the wife of the petitioner has never constituted any case under Section 498 A or 494of the Indian Penal Codeagainst the petitioner and it is only on the basis of Newspaper publication, Departmental Proceeding No.30 of 2007 was initiated. [xfed] [xfed] 8. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that the order of dismissal from service is also excessive inasmuch as in similar charges the other officers were awarded lesser punishment like Nindan (Censor), forfeiture of increments or reduction of pay scale on initial pay but in the instant case for similar offence, the petitioner has3been dismissed from service. He further referred paragraph Nos. 7, 8 and 9 of the rejoinder which has not been controverted by the counsel for the respondent. [xfed] 9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer of the petitioner and submits that being a Government servant that too in a disciplined force, the petitioner ought not to have committed such offence and the offence is against Rule 23 of the Conduct Rules, 1976, as such, no leniency should be granted to the petitioner. However, he could not controvert the specific submissions and statements made in the rejoinder affidavit filed the petitioner that in same and similar situation the other officials were awarded lesser punishment and not removal from service. [xfed] 10. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and after perusing the materials available on record, it is not in dispute that the petitioner is having extra marital relationship with other lady during the life time of his first wife but the first wife remained mum over the issue and did not make any complaint. The matter cropped up only on the basis of paper publication in ""Dainik Jagran"" and ""Hindustan Daily"" on 16.05.2007. It is also not in dispute that a proceeding was previously initiated against the petitioner for not keeping his wife and children in good condition and having extra marital relationship with another woman in which the petitioner was also awarded punishment of lowering down two increments. [xfed] [xfed] 11. It is true and a well settled law that bigamy is legally barred under the Hindu Law but for the same offence the petitioner has cited few orders which is annexed as Annexure 8, 9 and 10 of rejoinder in which lesser punishment has been awarded to those delinquents and the said submission has not been controverted by the respondent State. Hence, the said submission and statement made in the rejoinder to that effect remains intact on the doctrine of non traverse. [xfed] [xfed] 12. Though generally Court precludes from interfering with the impugned order, unless the punishment order is one which shocks the conscience of the Court and the4case in hand, the impugned order for dismissal dated 01.02.2012, appears to be shockingly disproportionate and not commensurate with the charges, hence, on the ground of doctrine of proportionality, the instant application needs interference. [xfed] 13. In view of the aforesaid facts and discussions, especially the fact that the petitioner was already awarded punishment of lowering down 2 increments on almost same set of allegations, the impugned order dated 01.02.2012 issued by the respondent No.3, whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service, is hereby quashed and set aside and the instant application is remitted back to the respondent No.3 to pass fresh order on the ground of parity and doctrine of proportionality within a period of 12 weeks from the date of receipt of this order. [xfed] [xfed] 15. With the aforesaid observations and directions, the instant writ application is allowed and disposed of. [xfed] [xfed] (Deepak Roshan, J.) Pramanik/ AFR"

No. 534 of 2020 This interlocutory application has been filed for condoning the delay of 58 days, which has occurred in preferring the present appeal. [xfed] Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the averments made in the application, we are of the view that the appellants were prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal within the period of limitation. [xfed] Accordingly, the delay of 58 days in preferring the present appeal is hereby condoned and this application stands allowed. L. P. A. No. 709 of 2018 Heard learned counsel for the appellants and the respondents. [xfed] There is no iota of doubt from any angle that there was no requirement of filing this appeal by the writ petitioners as the learned Single Judge has already granted sufficient time to hand over the possession of the respective quarters to the respondents and direction was given to release the gratuity along with interest payable to the writ petitioners. Still the writ petitioners did not vacate the quarters though they gave undertakings that they will vacate it rather they have filed this appeal and remained further in occupation of the quarter for about two years unauthorizedly. Thus, in our opinion, they are4.liable to pay rent for unauthorized period of occupation in view of the decision rendered in Ram Naresh Singh Vs. Bokaro Steel Ltd. and others (Civil Appeal No. 4740 of 2017) passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and a decision passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited & Ors Vs. Sada Nand Singh (L.P.A. No. 733 of 2018 and analogous cases). [xfed] In view of the conduct of the writ petitioners-appellants also, we are not persuaded to intervene in the matter as they would be required to vacate the quarter. We were also of the opinion to impose heavy cost and penal rent in view of their conduct but at the time of hearing learned counsel for the appellants has urged before us that all of them are retired persons and they would face great hardship if such type of direction or order is passed. In that view of the matter, we are refraining ourselves from imposing of penal rent but as per the decision rendered by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited & Ors Versus Sada Nand Singh (L.P.A. No. 733 of 2018 and analogous cases) following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram Naresh Singh Vs. Bokaro Steel Ltd. and others (Civil Appeal No. 4740 of 2017), the writ petitioners would be required to pay rent at the normal rate if they vacate the quarters within a period of four weeks from today. They will also have to pay the rent at normal rate for the unauthorised period of occupation which shall5.be calculated by the respondents and would be supplied to the writ petitioners along with the electricity and water charges, if payable. [xfed] In case of non-compliance of the direction, i.e., if they do not vacate the quarter within a period of four weeks from today and do not pay the calculated rent at normal rate within a period of three months from the date of the same being raised then in such case they would be liable to pay penal rent fixed in accordance with law by the respondents authorities. If they do not vacate the quarters then the authorities would be at liberty to get them vacated through the process of law and recover penal rent also. [xfed] However, it is made clear that the aforesaid would have no connection with the release of gratuity and payment of statutory interest upon the gratuity amount as per law.

On 07.07.2020 Delivered on 01/09/2020. [xfed] Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. [xfed] 2. The instant application has been preferred by the original-petitioner-Rajesh Kumar Singh, for quashing and setting aside the order passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Budget), Jharkhand, Ranchi communicated by letter No. 4095 dated 11.08.2009 (Annexure-19) whereby the departmental appeal preferred by the original-petitioner has been rejected. It has also been prayed for quashing of the Memo No. 93 dated 31.10.2008 (Annexur-16) and office order as contained in Memo No. 7352 dated 01.11.2008 (Annexure- [xfed] 17) issued by the Superintendent of Police, (Vigilance) Bureau, Jharkhand, Ranchi, whereby the original-petitioner has been dismissed from service w.e.f. 31.10.2008.2 [xfed] 3. After the death of the original-petitioner the name of his widow and other legal heirs were substituted pursuant to the order dated 08.02.2017 passed in the instant case. [xfed] 4. The instant case has a chequered history. The original- petitioner was appointed as Constable by office Order No. 23/90 dated 27.01.1990. After his appointment the original- petitioner was sent for Constable and Traffic Police Training at Traffic Training School, Jamshedpur. Thereafter, in the year, 1993, he was declared successful in departmental examination held in the year, 1993 and was also issued a certificate. After 12 years of his service, the original-petitioner was sent for PTC/ACP training in which also he was declared successful. [xfed] All of sudden, in the year, 1997 the Government of Bihar has taken a decision by Office Order as contained in Memo No. 140 dated 25.02.1997 to terminate the services of eight persons whose appointment was said to be illegal and accordingly, the then Superintendent of Police of the respective districts were directed to ensure that those eight persons are terminated. After creation of the State of Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Government vide Memo No.1389 dated 23.10.2003 also directed the concerned Superintendent of Police of different districts giving the names of nine persons saying that they have been illegally appointed by one Sri Vijay Pratap Singh, the then Inspector General of Police, just prior to his superannuation and as such, the appointment of those3nine persons are illegal and the respective Superintendent of Police were directed to ask for a show cause from them. [xfed] The original-petitioner being aggrieved by the said memo filed a writ application being W.P.(S) No. 5300 of 2003, which has been disposed of directing the respondent not to terminate the services of the original-petitioner in a routine manner and it has also been directed to take any action after giving proper show cause mentioning the reasons for the proposed termination. Thereafter, the original-petitioner was issued show-cause notice dated 14.11.2003 to which he replied. Thereafter, he was issued another show-cause notice dated 01.03.2004. Subsequently, the original-petitioner was once again issued show-cause notice as contained in Memo No. 1519/GS dated 22.09.2006 directing him to file a reply as to why his services be not terminated on the same set of charges i.e. his appointment is illegal as he was appointed by Sri Vijay Pratap Singh, who was not competent to appoint him. The original-petitioner filed its reply to show-cause on 01.10.2006, denying the allegations leveled against him stating therein that he was appointed in accordance with law and as per the provisions of Police Manual. However, the show-cause reply was not considered and the petitioner was terminated vide order as contained in Memo No. 1590 dated 09.10.2006 issued by the Inspector General of Police. Pursuant to that, the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) Bureau issued a departmental order informing the original-4petitioner that he has been terminated w.e.f. 11.10.2006. [xfed] The original-petitioner immediately preferred an appeal against the order of termination dated 09.10.2006 before the appellate Authority and when no action was taken, he preferred writ application before this Court being W.P.(S) No. 371 of 2008, praying therein for quashing the order of termination. [xfed] The said writ application was disposed of vide order dated 03.03.2008, directing the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance), Ranchi to dispose of the appeal pending before him. Pursuant to the said order, the original-petitioner immediately filed representation before the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) Jharkhand, Ranchi, but no action was taken in pursuance to the order dated 03.03.2008. Thereafter, the original-petitioner filed a contempt application being Cont. (Civil) Case No. 512 of 2008 before this Court for non- compliance of the order. However, during pendency of this contempt application, the original-petitioner received a letter of reinstatement as contained in Memo No. 1926 dated 27.09.2008. [xfed] Thereafter, the original-petitioner was issued a show- cause notice dated 29.09.2008 issued by the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance Bureau, Ranchi whereby, he was directed to submit his reply to the show-cause notice so that departmental proceeding could be initiated against him. He was also served with a charge-sheet as contained in Memo No.56937 dated 29.09.2008. In pursuance to the said show-cause notice and charge-sheet dated 29.09.2008, the original- petitioner immediately filed his detailed reply denying all allegations leveled against him. Thereafter, a departmental proceeding was conducted and the original-petitioner was terminated vide order as contained in Memo No. 93 dated 31.10.2008. [xfed] Thereafter, the original-petitioner filed a departmental appeal on 10.11.2008, and during pendency of the departmental appeal, the original-petitioner also filed a writ application being W.P.(S) No. 327 of 2009, however, the said writ application was dismissed as withdrawn by order dated 29.01.2009 passed by this Court. [xfed] 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the order of termination and order of appeal are totally arbitrary, mala-fide and without jurisdiction and as such, are liable to be set aside on the sole ground that it has been passed in most mechanical manner and without considering the points raised by the petitioner and the observations made by this Court. Learned counsel further contended that even the appellate authority in great haste did not consider the merits of the case and the points raised by the original-petitioner. She further contended that the appellate authority gravely erred in holding that the original-petitioner was not appointed in accordance with law on the ground that the Sargent Major was not the competent authority to take a decision with6regard to medical test. She finally concluded her argument by submitting that though the original-petitioner has filed several writ applications and during pendency of this writ application he expired and now his legal heirs including his widow is before this court, as such, their case may be considered sympathetically. [xfed] 6. Per contra, learned counsel for the State submits that the instant application is fit to be dismissed because for the same set of reliefs, the original-petitioner had earlier filed a writ application before this Court and ultimately withdrew the same; as such, the petitioner is not entitled to raise the grounds which has already been raised and decided in the earlier case. He further contended that the original-petitioner- Rajesh Kumar Singh was appointed as constable by the then Inspector General of Police by violating the established rules of Police Manual and his termination is in accordance with Rules after following the due procedure as per the direction of this Court. He further submits that an illegal appointment cannot continue to sustain due to passage of time. [xfed] 7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on record, it transpires that the contention of the respondent-counsel that the instant writ application is hit by the principle of res judicata is not sustainable in the eyes of law because the order passed in W.P.(S) No. 327 of 2009 was dismissed as withdrawn and the case was not decided on merit. However, I am in agreement7with the other submissions of the learned counsel for the State that the appointment of the original-petitioner was not in accordance with law and the rules of Police Manual. There was no open advertisement and the original-petitioner was appointed by the Inspector General of Police, though, the appointing authority for constable is Superintendent of Police. An illegal appointment cannot be legalized by passage of time. In this regard reference may be made to the Judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Orissa versus Mamata Mohanty reported in (2011) 3 SCC 436 where in para-37 & 38, the law has been laid down as under: [xfed] "" 37. It is a settled legal proposition that if an order is bad in its inception, it does not get sanctified at a later stage. A subsequent action/development cannot validate an action which was not lawful at its inception, for the reason that the illegality strikes at the root of the order. It would be beyond the competence of any authority to validate such an order. It would be ironic to permit a person to rely upon a law, in violation of which he has obtained the benefits. If an order at the initial stage is bad in law, then all further proceedings consequent thereto will be non est and have to be necessarily set aside. A right in law exists only and only when it has a lawful origin. (Vide Upen Chandra Gogoi v. State of Assam16,Mangal Prasad Tamoli v. Narvadeshwar Mishra17andRitesh Tewari v. State of U.P.18). [xfed] 38. The concept of adverse possession of lien on post or holding over are not applicable in service jurisprudence. Therefore, continuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not create any right in his favour. [Vide M.S. Patil (Dr.) v. Gulbarga University19.] Eligibility lacking"" [xfed] 8. The issue is now no more res integra that if the original appointment was not made by following due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules, the appointment itself is illegal. Even the Director General of Police has no discretionary power to make any appointment on the post of8constable. There is nothing like absolute power vested in any authority to appoint any person. When the law provides procedure for appointment to a public post then the appointment is to be made by following the said procedure. [xfed] From the record it clearly transpires that there was no open advertisement and no due process of selection was followed as envisaged in the relevant Rules. It also transpires that the said Sri Vijay Pratap Singh made several appointments like the petitioner just on the verge on his retirement without having any power to appoint the constables and in complete violation of the relevant rules of the Police Manual. [xfed] 9. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the discussions made hereinabove, the original- petitioner was not entitled for any relief as prayed for in the instant writ application; as a result, the instant writ application is dismissed.

JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR DWIVEDI [xfed] --------- [xfed] learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel for the respondent State. [xfed] 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. [xfed] 3. Petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 05.09.2019 contained in Annexure-4, whereby the service of the petitioner working on the post of Block Accounts Manager, Kashmar, Bokaro, has been terminated. [xfed] 4. Mr. Prem Pujari Roy, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that an advertisement was issued by Jharkhand Rural Health Mission,2for filling of various post including the post of Block Accounts Manager. The petitioner applied for the same and being eligible, he was asked to participate in interview. The appointment letter was issued in favour of the petitioner vide letter dated 01.10.2008. By letter dated 15.10.2008 the petitioner has been posted at Primary Health Centre, Gomia Block. The primary work of the petitioner was to provide assistance in execution of accounts related to various health programs running at block level and further for execution of National Rural Health Mission, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, use of computer and other instruments. The petitioner joined on 18.10.2008 at Primary Health Centre, Gomia and petitioner was discharging his duty. The petitioner was rendering his service under the control of Civil Surgeon, Bokaro. Since the date of joining, the petitioner was rendering his continuous service since more than a decade. There has been certain irregularities and illegalities committed by the certain employees in National Health Rural Mission and thereby it has been alleged that a sum of Rs. 6,97,43,832.29/- has been misappropriated by them. For the aforesaid misappropriation, F.I.R. has been instituted against ten persons including the petitioner being Dhanbad P.S. Case No. 15 of 2019 dated 26.08.2019 for the offence undersections 109/120B/406/409/420/467/471/477I.P.C. and undersection 13(1)of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 and in view of the said allegation, the service of the petitioner has been terminated which was on contractual basis. [xfed] 5. The case of the respondents is that the investigation was done by the Anti Corruption Bureau regarding several financial irregularities under National Health Mission in Dhanbad district. The information obtained during the said investigation about financial irregularities in the Community Health Centre, Jodhapokhar was published in Dainik Jagran newspaper. In the light of this, Managing Director, NHM was directed vide letter dated 11.03.2019, 10.07.20193and 01.08.2019 for immediate action against Shri Ajit Kumar, District Account Manager, Shri Pramod Kumar, Block Account Manager, Jodhapokhar, Shri Arun Kumar Singh, Block Account Manager, Primary Health Centre, Bhaghmara and Shri Ramjay Kumar Singh, who were involved in irregularities and misappropriation. The Anti Corruption Bureau, Ranchi lodged F.I.R against the petitioner and others for embezzlement of government money allotted under NRHM scheme at Primary Health Centre, Jharia-cum-Jodhapokhar, Dhanbad. Clarification was sought from the petitioner vide letter no. 838 (MD) dated 09.08.2019. Thereafter petitioner's contract was terminated vide letter dated 05.09.2019. [xfed] 6. Mr. Prem Pujari Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that without any appropriate proceeding, the petitioner's service has been brought to an end and in view of violation of principles of natural justice, impugned order is fit to be quashed. He further submitted that it was incumbent upon the respondents to await the outcome of criminal case initiated against the petitioner but without awaiting, dismissal order has been passed. [xfed] 7. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon judgment of this Court passed in L.P.A. No. 692 of 2005 dated 17.07.2006. He has relied upon judgment in the case of ""Raj Kumar Singh Vs. Ranchi Regional Development Authority and Ors"" reported in (2008) 1 JCR 265 (Jhr). [xfed] 8. Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that the petitioner was contractual employee. He has no right to continue in service. He further submitted that opportunity of show-cause has been provided to the petitioner. Referring to letter dated 05.09.2019 contained in Annexure-C to the counter-affidavit, he submitted that show-cause was asked from the petitioner but the petitioner has chosen not to reply show-cause. [xfed] 9. The Court has perused Annexure-C which is letter dated 05.09.20194whereby it transpires that show-cause was asked from the petitioner but the petitioner has chosen not to reply. A criminal case is pending against the petitioner and others for mis-appropriation of huge amount in the light of Anti Corruption Bureau investigation. Petitioner's service is not governed by any statutory Rule. Petitioner has not been appointed on regular basis. The service of the petitioner is governed in terms of agreement on the basis of the same petitioner has been employed. Reference in this regard may be made to the case of ""State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Sandhya Tomar"" reported in (2013) 11 SCC 357 in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:- [xfed] ""9. There can be no dispute with respect to the settled legal proposition that in the event that a person is not appointed on a regular basis, and if his service is not governed by any statutory rules, he shall be bound by the terms and conditions that have been incorporated in his appointment letter. (Vide State of Punjab Vs. Surinder Kumar. In such an eventually, there can be no reason with respect to why the terms and conditions incorporated in the appointment letter should not be enforced against such an employee. In the instant case, Respondent 1 was temporarily appointed in a project and thus, she had at no point of time, been appointed on a regular basis, owing to which she cannot claim any lien with respect to the said post."" [xfed] 10. So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in L.P.A. No. 692 of 2005 is concerned, this is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case as in that caseArticle 311of the Constitution of India was considered and the service of the employee was governed by certain provisions. So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in Raj Kumar Singh (supra) case is concerned, is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case as in that case where the petitioner was terminated without notice and the petitioner was not facing any criminal trial whereas, in the present case the petitioner is facing a criminal case of5misappropriation of huge amount. Law is well-settled that contractual employee has no right to continue in service in absence of any statutory provision, thus the said judgment is not helping the petitioner. [xfed] 11. It is well-settled proposition of law that casual employee engaged on daily wages basis, on termination of his service, claiming right to continue in service and temporary status covered by theIndustrial Disputes Actand remedy lies before the Tribunal or before the Labour Court and not before the High Court. Admitted position is that the petitioner has been appointed on contractual basis for that agreement has been entered into. [xfed] 12. In view of cumulative effect of the above discussions, there is no merit in the writ petition. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. [xfed] (Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi, J.)

On physical verification of the work assigned to Sunil Kumar, it is alleged that there was a difference of Rs.24,65,650/- between the advance taken by said Sunil Kumar and the work done. The F.I.R. was instituted for recovery of Rs.64,120/- with regard to ten BRGF Projects of Patratu Block under Basal P.S.

[xfed] The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with the petitioner on 19.06.2018. It has been alleged that in the first night the complainant discovered that the petitioner is impotent. It has further been alleged there was a demand of a car and on nonfulfillment of the said demand as well as the disclosure of the impotency of the petitioner the complainant was subjected to torture.

It has been stated that the impotency of the petitioner was suppressed but subsequently in the first night itself when the said fact came to the knowledge to the complainant she was threatened with dire consequences by the petitioner if the said fact was disclosed by the complainant. [xfed] It appears from the complaint petition that the allegations are general and omnibus in nature so far as the present petitioner is concerned with respect to the demand of a car and the subsequent torture committed upon the complainant.

Firstly, the petitioner has been convicted underSection 417of Indian Penal Code, although the petitioner was charged underSections 376/316of IPC and accordingly, the gist of acquisition for offence underSections 415/417of IPC was never explained to the petitioner. He submits that this aspect of the matter goes to the root of the case and in absence of explaining the gist of acquisition to the petitioner underSections 415/417of IPC, the petitioner could not have been convicted under the said section. [xfed] 4. Further argument of the petitioner is that by the impugned order a fine amount of Rs. 5,000/- has been imposed by recording that the petitioner was earning, but he has stated in para-5 of the memo of revision that the petitioner was remanded in custody on 23.10.2002 and he was under detention till the date of the judgment i.e. on 23.09.2004 and as such the petitioner could not have been said to be an earning person. [xfed] 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in this view of the matter, the punishment, so far as it relates to imposition of fine, is perverse and is fit to be set-aside. The2learned counsel further submits that so far as the other part of the punishment is concerned, the same has already been served by the petitioner as has been recorded by the learned lower appellate court. He refers to section 15 of Juvenile Justice Act. [xfed] 6. The learned counsel also refers to Section 19 of the Juvenile Justice Act to submit that an observation may be made that the petitioner will not be disqualified in future pursuant to the impugned judgement. The learned counsel has also referred toSection 222of Code of Criminal Procedure. [xfed] 7. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party, on the other hand, vehemently opposes the prayer and submits that the Juvenile Justice Board as well as the learned lower appellate court have scrutinized the evidences on record and in fact a case underSection 376of IPC was made out, but still the Juvenile Justice Board has convicted the petitioner only underSection 417of IPC. She submits that there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgements and the petitioner does not deserve any sympathetic view of this court. However, she does not dispute that the judgment passed by the Juvenile Justice Board was never challenged by the State or by the victim. [xfed] 8. Hearing is concluded. [xfed] 9.

Only one paragraph of the examination in chief was recorded by the court below thereafter in the second paragraph the Principal Sessions Judge, Giridih has mentioned that there is chance of settlement as such the examination is differed. [xfed] This court fails to understand as to how the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Giridih, has deferred the examination of victim and adjourned the case holding that there is a chance of settlement, where accused are facing trial and the offences are not compoundable. The recording of the second paragraph prima facie suggests that court on his own motion has adjourned the case. The offences are not compoundable. Suo moto adjourning the case in the midst of recording evidence by the court in the manner it has been done is not proper. This type of adjournment with the ground mentioned in paragraph 2 of the deposition encourages tampering with the evidence. No court can be a party to it.

This Cr.M.P. has been filed invoking the jurisdiction of this Court underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to quash the order dated 26.11.2009 passed by learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Ranchi whereby and where under learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Ranchi has found prima facie case for the offences punishable underSections 423,424,467,468,469,471,477A,409,201,109and120-Bof the Indian Penal Code andSection 13(1) (d) read with 13 (2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the petitioner and the co-accused persons of the case and accordingly took cognizance against the petitioner as well as the entire criminal proceeding in connection with Special Case No.15 of 2000 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No.28 of 2000. [xfed] 3. The brief facts of this case is that one Tulsidas Kanodia sold 11 kathas of land pertaining to plot No.28 falling within the urban area of Ranchi on 01.07.1982 to the vendor of the petitioner namely Vir Kumar Jain. Since the proceeding under the Urban Land (Ceiling and1Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') was going on, hence, the vendor of the petitioner filed an application before the competent authority for dropping the proceeding as far as the 11 kathas of the land is concerned but the application was rejected on 06.07.1987 by holding that the deed of transfer is null and void. In spite of that, the vendor of the petitioner sold the land to the petitioner and another person on 12.06.1989 concealing the fact that his prayer for dropping of the proceeding with respect to that land had already been rejected by the competent authority. In spite of that, the land was mutated in the name of the petitioner in violation of the provision as contained inSection 5(3)of the Act. It is alleged that the petitioner in criminal conspiracy with the co-accused persons including the Revenue Officers and the Officers of the concerned Government department abetted the commission of the said act. [xfed] 4. After completion of the investigation charge-sheet has been submitted and by the impugned order cognizance of the said offences has been taken inter alia against the petitioner. [xfed] 5. Mrs. J. Mazumdar- learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even accepting that the entire allegations against the petitioner are true, what the petitioner is alleged to have done is that in spite of the application filed for dropping out 11 kathas of the land from the Land Ceiling being rejected, the petitioner was instrumental in the said land getting transferred to his name and got the said transferred land mutated in his name. It is next submitted that at best the transfer which was made in the name of the petitioner on 12.06.1989 may be null and void but certainly the petitioner cannot be prosecuted for any criminal offence of forgery,2Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 criminal breach of trust, fraudulent execution of deed of transfer or dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment of property. It is next submitted that the essential ingredients to constitute the offence punishable underSection 13(1) (d) ofPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is lacking and the fact that the petitioner came into picture after a period of about 7 years from the original purchase of the land by the vendor from the person in possession of the land in excess of the land prescribed under the Act namely Tulsidas Kanodia. It is then submitted that, it cannot be said that the criminal conspiracy was going on for a period of more than seven years in which the petitioner was allegedly involved. It is also submitted that the cognizance taken against the co- accused persons namely Vir Kumar Jain has been quashed vide order dated 07.11.2012 in Cr.M.P. No.982 of 2012, cognizance in respect of Jagnarayan Singh has been quashed vide order dated 07.11.2012 in Cr.M.P.

No.591 of 2013 and cognizance in respect of Indu Sinha has been quashed vide order dated 06.12.2013 in Cr. Revision No.75 of 2013. Hence, it is submitted by Mrs. J. Mazumdar that the impugned order dated 26.11.2009 passed by learned Special Judge,3Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 Vigilance, Ranchi by which cognizance has been taken for the said offences so far as it relates to this petitioner, be quashed. [xfed] 6. Mr. Suraj Verma- learned counsel for the Vigilance on the other hand submits that the petitioner has purchased and got mutated 11 kathas of land of Tulsidas Kanodia though the competent authority for dropping out the said 11 kathas of land, which was purchased by the vendor of the petitioner, has dismissed the said proceeding and the vendor of the petitioner as well as the petitioner without bringing the fact to the notice of the competent authority for registration of the sale deed and mutation of the said land in favour of this petitioner, has got the same mutated in the name of the petitioner in conspiracy with the co-accused persons. It is next submitted by Mr. Verma that at the stage of cognizance and summoning, the Magistrate is required to apply his mind only with the view to take cognizance of the offence and at the time of taking cognizance, the Magistrate is not required to evaluate the merits of the material. In support of this contention, Mr. Verma relies upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Sonu Gupta Vs. Deepak Gupta & Others reported in (2015) 3 SCC 424 para-8 of which reads as under:- [xfed] 8. ""Having considered the details of allegations made in the complaint petition, the statement of the complainant on solemn affirmation as well as materials on which the appellant placed reliance which were called for by the learned Magistrate, the learned Magistrate, in our considered opinion, committed no error in summoning the accused persons. At the stage of cognizance and summoning the Magistrate is required to apply his judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of the offence, or, in other words, to find out whether prima facie case has been made out for summoning the accused persons. At this stage, the learned Magistrate is not required to consider the defence version or materials or arguments nor is he required to evaluate the merits of the materials or evidence of the4Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 complainant, because the Magistrate must not undertake the exercise to find out at this stage whether the materials will lead to conviction or not.""(Emphasis supplied) Hence, it is submitted that there is ample material in the record to take cognizance against the petitioner and as the learned court below having rightly taken the cognizance against the petitioner, this Cr.M.P. being without any merit be dismissed. [xfed] 7. Having heard the submissions made at the Bar and after carefully going through the evidence in the record, it appears that the vendor of the petitioner having purchased 11 kathas of land from Tulsidas Kanodia on 01.07.1982 filed an application before the competent authority in a proceeding which has been initiated against the original land holder for dropping out of the proceeding for 11 kathas of land. The application got dismissed. In spite of that the vendor of the petitioner sold the land to the petitioner and another purchaser on 12.06.1989 by separate registered sale-deed. There is no material in the record to suggest that the petitioner had any knowledge about the said misdeeds of his vendor but only because he purchased the land from the co- accused vendor namely Veer Kumar Jain, hence, he has been implicated in this case for having been in criminal conspiracy with the co-accused public servant officers and staffs of the revenue department as well as the original land holder Tulsidas Kanodia and his vendor committed the offences alleged. UnderSection 10of the Act if one transfers the land which was the subject matter of the proceeding after the notification is issued underSection 10(3) of the said Act, the transfer would be deemed to be null and void. At the same time, the Act also prescribe that if one who is holding land excess than ceiling limit transfer of such land becomes null and void. [xfed] Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 TheSection 464of the Indian Penal Code divides false documents into three categories:- [xfed] (i) Firstly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made or executed by some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed. [xfed] (ii) Secondly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it has been made or executed by either himself or any other person. [xfed] (iii) Thirdly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of [xfed] (a) unsoundness of mind; [xfed] (b) intoxication; or [xfed] (c) deception practiced upon him, know the contents of the document or the nature of alteration. In other words, a person is said to have made a ""false document"", if [xfed] (i) he makes or executes a document claiming to be someone else or authorized by someone else; or [xfed] (ii) he alters or tampers a document; or [xfed] (iii) he obtains a document by practicing deception, or from a person not in control of his senses. So even if the land transferred to the name of the petitioner by an erroneous or illegal order passed by a public servant being against the statute, the same does not constitute any offence punishable underSections 467,468,469,471and477or 477Aof the Indian Penal Codeas passing of an illegal order does not assume any characteristics of making a false document. At the same time, the allegations against the petitioner do not6Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 constitute the offence punishable underSection 409is not made out as there is no allegation of entrustment of any property to any Public Servant. Similarly, the offences punishable underSections 423or 424of the Indian Penal Codeis not made out as there is no allegation to suggest that the petitioner was having the knowledge of the fact that the said application to drop the said 11 katha of land was dismissed. Thus the essential ingredients of 'Fraudulently' as defined insection 26of the Indian Penal Code that the petitioner does the alleged acts with intent to defraud is not made out from the allegations made. [xfed] 8. So far as the offence punishable underSection 13(2)read withSection 13(1)(d)of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is concerned, though it is alleged that the petitioner in criminal conspiracy got transferred the land to his name in spite of the prayer of his vendor for dropping of the proceedings from the land purchased being rejected and being contrary to the provision of the statute but there is no allegation that the said act has been done by adopting corrupt practices or illegal means for having pecuniary advantage/valuable thing for himself or for any other person. In the absence of the said essential ingredients to constitute the offences punishable underSection 13(1) (d) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted underSection 13(1) (d) read withSection 13(2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988. [xfed] Thus, this Court is of the considered view that the instant case falls within the category (1) and (3) which reads as under : [xfed] (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. [xfed] Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. [xfed] enunciated in the illustrative lists of the cases where the cognizance can be quashed either in exercise of the jurisdiction underArticle 226of the Constitution of India or the inherent power underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure to prevent the abuse of the process of Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others Vs. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335]. Hence, it will be gross abuse of the process of law if the criminal proceeding is allowed to continue against the petitioner and the petitioner is asked to face rigor of criminal trial when the allegations made against him in the first information report and the charge-sheet even if are taken at their face value and are accepted to be true do not constitute any offence against the petitioner. [xfed] 9. Accordingly, the entire criminal proceeding of Special Case No.15 of 2000 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No.28 of 2000 registered underSections 423,424,467,468,469,471,477A,409,201,109and120-Bof the Indian Penal Code andSection 13(1) (d) read with 13 (2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 including the order taking cognizance, so far as it relates to petitioner, is quashed and set aside. [xfed] 10. In the result, this application is allowed. [xfed] (Anil Kumar Choudhary, J.) AFR-Animesh/8"

Petitioners, through this criminal miscellaneous petition have prayed for quashing the entire criminal proceeding, the FIR and the order dated 22.12.2018 passed in Complaint Case No.1409 of 2018, whereby the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate sent a copy of complaint petition to the Officer-in-Charge underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with a direction to register a First Information Report and submit a report after investigation. [xfed] 2. This case was listed under the heading ""For Orders"". Counsel for the parties in course of arguments, submitted that this criminal miscellaneous petition can be disposed of at the stage of 'Orders' itself, so they finally argued at length. After hearing the parties, the final order was reserved, which is being delivered today. [xfed] 3. The present case arises out of complaint case being Complaint Case No.1409 of 2018. The opposite party No.2 had initially filed Sanha on 22.11.2018 and thereafter had filed the complaint in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro. The complainant earlier lodged an FIR being Sector P.S. Case No.86 of 2018 against Mr. Uni Krishnan, MD, Thermax Ltd. alleging fraudulent business transaction. It is alleged that the petitioners, claiming themselves as Officers of Thermax Ltd., contacted the complainant on 14.08.2018 through his mobile phone 9934123755 for amicable solution of the aforesaid case. The complainant had at first refused to the proposal of2meeting, but, later on agreed to meet the accused persons on 15.08.2018 at Hans Regency. The complainant along with Mr. Kamal Kishore Prasad and Dilip Kumar Singh, who was his staff went to the said Hotel at Room No.412 to meet the petitioners. It is alleged that the amicable communication turned into squabbled. Petitioner No.1 started creating compulsion on the complainant to withdraw the said case. It is alleged that if he will settle on their terms and conditions, then the complainant will be compensated by an amount of Rs.10,00,000/-. It is alleged that the complainant was not willing to bow down to the rash behaviour and mischievous intentions. Seeing such contrary opinion of the complainant, it is alleged that the petitioner No.1 dishonestly induced the complainant that he can turn the table and bring change in scenario for which the complainant will have to pay Rs.20,00,000/-. It is alleged that the petitioners put the complainant in fear of his death and that of his family members if he resists from either to withdraw Sector 4 P.S. Case No.86 of 2018 or pay them the amount of Rs.20,00,000/-. It is alleged that the complainant was also physically assaulted by the petitioners in the Hotel Room, but due to intervention by Kamal Kishore Prasad, the complainant came out of the hotel room and was very ill due to such unexpected event. Due to his deteriorating health, he was taken to America for treatment on 23.09.2018. It is alleged that on 24.10.2018, when the complainant came back to India, he started receiving extortion calls from unknown numbers for Rs.20,00,000/-, whereafter he registered a Sanha in Sector 1 Police Station on 22.11.2018. It is alleged on 17.12.2018, one more letter was given to the Officer-in-Charge, Sector 1 Police Station as reminder, but FIR was not registered by the police against the petitioners due to their influence and approaches. It is alleged that the complainant is still living in great fear and apprehension that the petitioners may commit murder of the complainant and his family members. [xfed] 4. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners, challenging the First Information Report, submits that no offence at all far less a criminal offence is made out from a bare perusal of the First Information Report. He submits that a complaint was filed in utter violation of the provisionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure and the complaint was referred underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure for registering a First Information Report. He submits that there was no application of mind in sending the complaint to the police under the provisions ofSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that the order dated322.12.2018, by which the complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the B.S. City Police for registering a First Information Report is not only cryptic, but, it is absolutely a non-speaking one. He further submits that if the complaint petition is seen (certified copy of the same has been filed), nowhere one could find any affidavit in terms ofSection 154of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that since there is a violation and non-compliance ofSection 154(1)and154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the entire First Information Report is liable to be quashed. He submits that the meeting, which had taken between the parties, was to resolve a dispute, which is commercial in nature for which earlier Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 was registered. He submits that it would be evident from the complaint petition that an offer was made to pay Rs.10,00,000/- by way of compensation / amicable solution and a submission was put forth in turn to withdraw the criminal case. This fact of negotiation cannot be said to be an extortion and also by no stretch of imagination can be said to be a threat. He submits that there is nothing on record to suggest that the accused persons had put the complainant in fear of death to extort Rs.20,00,000/-. By referring to paragraph 11 of the complaint, it is submitted that there is no element of extortion, as it was merely an offer either to withdraw Sector IV Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 or to pay them the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- for settling the dispute. He submits that this cannot be said to be extortion by any means. Reference of incidence of 24.08.2018, which is at paragraph 15, clearly suggests that the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- was demanded for settling the dispute and nothing more. Lastly, it was submitted that since no offence is made out, First Information Report is liable to be quashed. [xfed] 5. Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party No.2 submits that from perusal of paragraphs 11 to 16 and 17 of the Complaint petition, a cognizable offence is definitely made out, thus, the Court was well within its jurisdiction to send the same for registering a First Information Report. He submits that since an offence is made out, the First Information Report cannot be quashed. He further submits that definitely the complainant was given threat and the petitioners demanded money, which clearly suggests that there was a threat of extortion. According to him, since an offence is made out the First Information Report cannot be quashed. It is also the case of the complainant that he received emails wherein money was4demanded for settling the dispute and some sarcastic comments were made from which he felt threatened. [xfed] 6. A complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure for registering a First Information Report. While I go through the complaint, I find that the said complaint is not accompanied by any affidavit.Section 154(1)of the Code of Criminal Procedure andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure are very important in this respect. As per the aforesaid sectionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure, every information relating to commission of cognizable offence has to be given orally or in writing to the Officer-in-Charge and the substance of such information shall be entered in the book kept in the office. This means a First Information Report has been lodged when the police received an information about cognizable offence. If there is a refusal to register a First Information Report, then the remedy lies inSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein the aggrieved person may send the substance of such information in writing by post to the Superintendent of Police, who can investigate or direct an investigation, if according to him, a cognizable offence is made out. In this case, I find that nothing has been mentioned in the complaint, as to whether this provision ofSection 154(1)orSection 154(3)was invoked. Rather, the counsel for the opposite party No.2 could not satisfy the Court on this question and also there is no whisper in the complaint petition about the same. Without exhausting the mandatory provisions, the complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [xfed] 7. Remedy available underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not routine in nature. It requires application of mind and a speaking order to be passed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Another versus the State of Uttar Pradesh & Others reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, has dealt with this issue extensively. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Court highlighted the importance ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and has also dealt with the mis-use of the powers underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In paragraph 30 and 31 of the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in detail, has held as to how the Court has to deal in this situation. Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the said judgment reads as under: - [xfed] 30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country whereSection 156(3)CrPC applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the5Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the framework of the said Act or underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores. [xfed] 31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications underSections 154(1)and154(3)while filing a petition underSection 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction that an application underSection 156(3)be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making the application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate underSection 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari are being filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR. [xfed] 8. This judgment in Priyanka Srivastava (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been followed subsequently in Vikram Johar versus State of Uttar Pradesh & Another reported in (2019) SCC Online SC 609. Thus, I find that the order by which the Court had referred the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a non-speaking one and6the complaint itself does not comply with the preconditions as set forth in the aforesaid judgment, which is necessary for sending the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [xfed] 9. Considering the aforesaid fact and position of law, order by which complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is absolutely bad. [xfed] 10. So far as merit of complaint is concerned, I find that the basic allegation is for settling previous dispute, i.e., Police Station Case No.86 of 2018, the parties met in a Hotel. From paragraph 7, it is clear that since long there was some dispute going on between the parties. In paragraph 8, it has been stated that accused No.2 has threatened the complainant that if the said case is not withdrawn, then the reputation of the complainant in his business will be hampered and the loss and damage will be beyond repair and if the case is withdrawn, then a compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- will be given to the complainant. In paragraph 10, it has also been mentioned that the accused No.1 dishonestly induced the complainant that he can turn the table and bring change in the scenario for which accused has to pay Rs.20,00,000/-. This offer and exchange went on between the parties during the talks of settlement, which took place in a hotel at Bokaro. I find that the complainant has only mentioned that because of this he felt threatened and he was in a fear of death. I find that this exchange of words cannot be said that there was any fear of death. Further this alleged demand of Rs.20,00,000/- or making an offer of Rs.10,00,000/- cannot be said to be an extortion or putting pressure. In course of arriving at a settlement, these offers were given.Section 383of the Indian Penal Code defines extortion, which is as under: - [xfed] 383 : - Extortion - Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property or valuable security, or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security commits 'extortion'. [xfed] The essential ingredients ofSection 383of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - [xfed] (1) The accused must put any person in fear of injury to that person or any other person; (2) The putting of fear in such person must be intentional. [xfed] (3) The accused must thereby induce the person so that in fear to deliver to any person any property, valuable security or anything so signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security; and (4) Such inducement must be done dishonestly. [xfed] As per the allegations in the complaint petition, there are no ingredients which in any manner can constitute the essential ingredients to constitute the offence underSection 383of the Indian Penal Code. [xfed] 11.Section 385of the Indian Penal Code is defined as under:- [xfed] 385 : - Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion - Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts any person in fear or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury, shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to 2 years or with fine or both. [xfed] The essential ingredients ofSection 385of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - [xfed] (1) Accused put or attempted to put any person in fear of injury; [xfed] (2) He did so to commit extortion. [xfed] From the facts of this case, I also do not find any ingredients to attractSection 385of the Indian Penal Code, as there is nothing to substantiate that there was a fear of injury. Mere putting a sentence that person was under fear of injury and life is not enough. [xfed] 12.Section 387of the Indian Penal Code reads as under:- [xfed] 387 : - Putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion - Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to that person or to any other shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. [xfed] The essential ingredients ofSection 387of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - [xfed] (1) Accused put some person or attempted to put some person in fear of death or grievous hurt; and (2) He did so to commit extortion. [xfed] On the facts of this case, as narrated above, the aforesaid Section is also not attracted. [xfed] 13.Section 503of the Indian Penal Code reads as under:- [xfed] 503 : - Criminal Intimidation - Whoever, threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person or cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation. [xfed] The essential ingredients ofSection 503of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - [xfed] (1) Any person threatens another with - [xfed] a. Injury to his person, reputation or property; or b. To any other person in whom that person is interested; [xfed] (2) Such threat is with respect to do or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do; [xfed] From the allegations in the complaint petition, no offence underSection 503of the Indian Penal Code even is made out as against the petitioners. [xfed] 14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others versus Bhajan Lal & Others reported in (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 at paragraph 102 of the said judgment has framed various categories of cases by way of illustration for exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226of the Constitution of India or the exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The said paragraph 102 of the said judgment reads as under: - [xfed] 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisionsof the Codeunder Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary9power underArticle 226or the inherent powers underSection 482of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. [xfed] (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. [xfed] (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers underSection 156(1)of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview ofSection 155(2)of the Code. [xfed] (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. [xfed] (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without any order of a Magistrate as contemplated underSection 155(2)of the Code. [xfed] (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. [xfed] (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisionsof the Codeor the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision inthe Codeor the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. [xfed] (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."" [xfed] 15. Thus, based on the discussions as above, in the light of the guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), I find that this case is a fit case and falls in Category (1) and (5) of the above guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. The entire criminal proceeding in B.S. City Police Station Case No.05 of 2019, so far as it relates to the petitioners, abovenamed, is hereby quashed. All subsequent proceedings are also quashed. [xfed] 16.

Petitioner, through this criminal miscellaneous petition has prayed for quashing the entire criminal proceeding, including First Information Report of Sector 4 Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 and all subsequent proceedings thereto lodged for the offence punishable underSections 406,420of the Indian Penal Code, pending in the Court of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate at Bokaro. [xfed] 2. This case was listed under the heading ""For Orders"". Counsel for the parties in course of arguments, submitted that this criminal miscellaneous petition can be disposed of at the stage of 'Orders' itself, so they finally argued at length. After hearing the parties, the final order was reserved, which is being delivered today. [xfed] 3. The first information report was registered on the basis of complaint case being Complaint Petition No.687 of 2018, which was forwarded by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro by order dated 07.07.2018 for registering the FIR and investigating the same in terms ofSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is alleged by the complainant-opposite party No.2 that the complainant is the Managing Partner of M/s. Kaizen Growth. It is alleged that he came in contact with Senior Executive of M/s Thermax Limited for making boiler/turbines and equipments for power and steel plant installation and both companies entered into a contract under specific terms and conditions to execute installation of power plants. It is alleged that firstly an agreement was signed for the first order of M/s. Adhunik Mettalik, Jamshedpur for installation of 30 MW power plant @ Rs.98 crore and2the order was placed on Thermax Limited and Kaizen Growth was the consultant/Liasoning Agent for this order, which was successfully executed on the agreed terms between the two companies and was fully maintained to the best of satisfaction. It has been alleged that on the successful performance by the firm of the complainant, M/s Thermax Limited again entered into an agreement for a large power plant project of SAIL/Rourkela Steel Plant (Orissa) vide work order No. P/Proj/287(II) 79001/77 dated 06.09.2007 for a value of Rs.418 crore. The agreement value of the complainant was Rs.2 crore on prorate basis. This large project took eight years to complete, i.e., from 2007 to 2015. It has been alleged that thereafter, yet again, an agreement was done with the complainant by M/s Thermax Limited for SAIL, Bhilai Steel Plant Project, where project was of Rs.700 crore. The accused Company M/s Thermax Limited made 4th agreement with the complainant for a water treatment project contract for SAIL/ Bokaro Steel Plant, CRM Zone under Tender No. T&C(M)/B 351/042 A/Skk/231 dated 18.03.2013. It has been alleged that in the year 2013, Income Tax Department conducted a survey on M/s. Thermax Limited at its Head Office at Mumbai Pune Road, Wakdewadi; Pune. All documents relating to the accused and complainant's company were also sent to Commissioner Central Excise, Pune for detail verification. It has been alleged that the petitioner was asked by the Commissioner, Central Excise, Pune I about Thermax's business relation with the company of the complainant M/s Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that to the great surprise and shock of the complainant, the petitioner stated on oath that M/s Thermax Limited does not hold any business relation with the company of the complainant M/s. Kaizen Growth and has not received any services from M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that this false and fraudulent statement made by the petitioner came as a turning point in the long business relation between them and the complainant's company M/s. Kaizen Growth was issued notices by the Dy. Commisioner, Pune (Central Excise) to explain and produce all related documents/payments/vouchers etc. to establish and find out the truth. The complainant produced all the related documents as demanded by the Dy. Commissioner. The complainant visited 5 times to Pune and the statement of the complainant was duly recorded by the Commissioner Office Superintendent on the business relation with M/s. Thermax Limited. It has been alleged that special audit was deputed to find facts and figures of the complainant's company M/s Kaizen Growth's financial and business relation with M/s Thermax Limited, Pune. It has been alleged that the petitioner has3made false and fraudulent statement to save CENVAT of Thermax Limited to the tune of Rs.32,55,78,926/-. It has been averred that it was established by the Commissioner that the petitioner fraudulently gave false statement to the Revenue Department on the business relation with the complainant which was based on written agreement. It has been alleged that all payments from M/s. Thermax to M/s. Kaizen Growth was made properly through account payee cheques after deduction of TDS and all service taxes were paid by the complainant's company M/s. Kaizen Growth as per Rules laid down covering all agreements. It has been averred that having gone through all documents, the Commissioner Central Excise, Pune imposed a heavy fine of Rs.10 lakh on the petitioner and a penalty was imposed along with interest on M/s. Thermax for Rs.1,34,60,350/-. It has been alleged that the petitioner paid these fines/penalty charges along with Rs.10,000/- as fine imposed upon the company of the complainant M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that due to the abovesaid activities of the accused company and petitioner, the reputation of the company of complainant, i.e., M/s. Kaizen Growth was totally damaged because of false/fraudulent statement/affidavit given by the petitioner. It has been alleged that the market image of the complainant's company was totally shattered and then after the complainant's company did not get a single contract from any company despite the clean chit given by the Central Excise Department to M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that to the extent when M/s Thermax Limited bagged an order of SAIL, Bokaro Steel Plant recently for a contract in RMPH Zone of SAIL, Bokaro Steel Plant, but the complainant's company was refused by M/s. Thermax Limited inspite of their commitments to work together for any SAIL projects in future. It has been alleged that the complainant represented/requested the petitioner through registered letter and reminded their old relation for all SAIL projects, but the petitioner has not responded the same. It has been alleged that the complainant also approached the local officials of M/s. Thermax Limited at Bokaro, Project Manager Mr. Manoj Jha on 03.07.2019, but of no result as he did not want even to talk to the complainant on mobile inspite of their 10 years deep business relation with M/s. Thermax Limited. It has been alleged that due to the above activities of the accused company, the marketing reputation of the complainant and his company suffered a huge loss by loosing their best business and reputation in National and International arena since then. It has been alleged that due to false and fraudulent acts of the petitioner, turn over of the complainant's company came down drastically from Rs.1 crore to NIL,4because he lost all clients and reputations in the market, even for the job, which M/s. Kaizen Growth had executed in past for the company namely M/s. Imeco Limited, Kolkata and M/s. Magadh Engineering Works, Industrial Area, Balidih, Bokaro Steel City. It has been alleged that M/s. Kaizen Growth in past executed with M/s. Imeco Limited, Kolkata, an EPC contract for six number of ESP/RMP Bokaro, order, but, when a fresh tender dated 13.03.2016 came for the same item, in Bokaro, M/s. Imeco Ltd. even on request refused to make an agreement with M/s. Kaizen Growth because of legal complication created by M/s. Thermax Limited (accused) for no fault of the complainant's company. It has been alleged that furthermore at the instance of the employees, who were looking for M/s Thermax Project with the complainant, took nearly Rs.10 lakh from the complainant including Rs.4 lakh cash. These payments were made to them through account payee cheques. These payments were made on refundable basis but payment was never refunded to the complainant. It has been alleged that to utmost surprise, being Thermax registered vendor, having Vendor Code No.133000 with M/s. Thermax Limited, who lied before the Commissioner and gave false and fraudulent on oath that caused the complainant a serious suffering mentally, financially and socially. In the circumstances set forth above, defamation that ruined the prestige, dignity of the complainant as well as his company by the petitioner, complainant sought Rs.3 crore against defamation plus Rs.10 lakh paid to them as per bank receipts. [xfed] 4. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, submits that even if the complaint is taken on its face value, no offence underSections 406/420of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He submits that the facts stated in the complaint, even if it is true, it suggests that the petitioner's company gave some false statement before the Income Tax Department with respect to the business relations of the petitioner company with the complainant. He submits that the aforesaid action cannot be said to be a criminal offence underthe Indian Penal Code. Further, he submits that even if paragraph 20 of the complaint is seen, it would be evident that the fine amount, which was imposed upon the complainant company was also paid by the petitioner company, which would go to show that there was no criminal intention. He submits that if there was any act (without admitting the same), which attracts an offence, it can at best be of saving of CENVAT by giving false statement, for which the petitioner company has already been penalized by the Revenue Authorities. By no stretch of imagination, the same can attract5any offence underthe Indian Penal Code. He submits that the claim of the complainant that his company suffered defamation, which ruined his prestige and dignity, cannot be a subject matter of criminal proceeding underSections 406,420of the Indian Penal Code. He submits that even the statement made in paragraph 28 of the complaint petition to the effect that some officers of M/s Thermax Limited (company of the petitioner) had taken Rs.10,00,000/- on refundable basis, but, did not refund the same, cannot also be a subject matter of the criminal case. He lastly submits that in utter violation of the provisions ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court, without applying its mind, has exercised jurisdiction underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directed the police to register a First Information Report. [xfed] 5. Learned counsel appearing for the opposite party opposes the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner had given a false statement before the Revenue Authorities for which the petitioner company suffered loss, as he was deprived of future business transactions. He submits that the complainant suffered mental harassment by loosing their future businesses. He submits that by making a false statement and taking CENVAT relief, is an offence, thus, offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code is made out. [xfed] 6. After hearing the parties, I find that the petitioner company had a business relation with the Company of the complainant. When the Income Tax Department conducted survey upon M/s Thermax Limited (petitioner's company) it is alleged that statements were given by the petitioners that they had no business relations with the company of the opposite party No.2. The complainant was called to produce all the related documents, which they had. Thereafter it was concluded by the Revenue Authorities that M/s Thermax Limited has made false statement to save CENVAT and M/s. Thermax Limited gave a false information that they had no relations with the company of the opposite party No.2. The Commissioner, Central Excise imposed a fine of Rs.10,00,000/- upon this petitioner, who is Managing Director of M/s. Thermax Limited along with interest. In paragraph 19 of the complaint petition, the complainant admits that M.S. Unikrishnan paid the fine and also the penal charges, which was imposed upon the complainant. It is the case of the complainant that because of this act, reputation of complainant's company was damaged. It is also the complainant's case that even though there was some arrangement between the complainant and the accused that the accused will6work together in future Government projects, but, the accused refused to do any business with the complainant. The complainant further stated that because of the aforesaid activity, the reputation of the complainant's company suffered a set-back and the turn over of the complainant's company came down from Rs.1 crore to NIL. As per the complainant, because of this act, he suffered mentally, financially and socially and thus, as per paragraph 13 of the complaint, he sought Rs.3 crore as defamation plus Rs.10 lakh as recovery amount, which, according to him, was paid to some of the officers of the petitioner's company. [xfed] 7. The facts, which are narrated above, are derived from the complaint itself. These facts, by no stretch of imagination, attract the offences punishable underSections 420or 406of the Indian Penal Code. [xfed] 9.Section 420of the Indian Penal Code is punishment for cheating, which reads as under: - [xfed] 420. Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property - Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. [xfed] To attract an offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code, the following requirements must be present: - [xfed] (i) Cheating; [xfed] (ii) dishonest inducement to deliver property or to make, alter or destroy any valuable security or anything which is sealed or signed or is capable of being converted into a valuable security; and [xfed] (iii) mens rea of the accused at the time of making inducement. [xfed] Section 415of the Indian Penal Code defines cheating, which reads as follows: - [xfed] 415. Cheating - Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or7intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to 'cheat'. [xfed] The essential ingredients of the offence of 'cheating' are: - [xfed] (i) deception of a person either by making a false or misleading representation or by other action or omission; [xfed] (ii) fraudulent or dishonest inducement of that person to either deliver any property or to consent to the retention thereof by any person or to intentionally induce that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. [xfed] 9. From a conjoint reading of aforesaid sections vis-à-vis the present case, I find that there is no allegation of delivering any property to any person, nor there is any allegation of altering or destroying any security. The element of deception vis-à-vis the complainant is missing in this case. The best allegation against the petitioner is that he suppressed the business relations between the petitioner and the complainant company with the Revenue Authorities to save tax. For this the complainant cannot be said to have been cheated. The revenue authorities, which was the only appropriate authority, has already imposed punishment upon the petitioner's company as per law. [xfed] Thus, there is no application ofSection 420of the Indian Penal Code in this case. [xfed] 10.Section 406is a punishment for criminal breach of trust. The word 'criminal breach of trust' is defined inSection 405of the Indian Penal Code, which reads as under: - [xfed] 405. Criminal breach of trust - Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract,8express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits 'criminal breach of trust'. [xfed] 11. From the facts narrated above, which is there in the complaint petition, I find that the petitioner was not entrusted with any property by the complainant nor did he dishonestly misappropriate or convert any property for his own use. On the facts stated above,Section 406of the Indian Penal Code is also not applicable in this case. [xfed] 12. These are the only two sections under which the first information report has been registered. Since there are no ingredients ofSections 406and420of the Indian Penal Code, registering of first information report is absolutely bad. [xfed] 13. Furthermore, the remedy available underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not routine in nature. It requires application of mind and a speaking order to be passed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Another versus the State of Uttar Pradesh & Others reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, has dealt with this issue extensively. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Court highlighted the importance ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and has also dealt with the mis-use of the powers underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In paragraph 30 and 31 of the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in detail, has held as to how the Court has to deal in this situation. Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the said judgment reads as under: - [xfed] 30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country whereSection 156(3)CrPC applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the framework of the said Act or underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. But it cannot be done to take9undue advantage in a criminal court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores. [xfed] 31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications underSections 154(1)and154(3)while filing a petition underSection 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction that an application underSection 156(3)be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making the application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate underSection 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari are being filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR. [xfed] 14. This judgment in Priyanka Srivastava (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been followed subsequently in Vikram Johar versus State of Uttar Pradesh & Another reported in (2019) SCC Online SC 609. Thus, I find that the order by which the Court had referred the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a non-speaking one and the complaint itself does not comply with the preconditions as set forth in the aforesaid judgment, which is necessary for sending the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [xfed] 15. Considering the aforesaid fact and position of law, order by which complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is absolutely bad. [xfed] 16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others versus Bhajan Lal & Others reported in (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 at paragraph 102 of the said judgment has framed various categories of cases by way of illustration for exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226of10the Constitution of India or the exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The said paragraph 102 of the said judgment reads as under: - [xfed] 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisionsof the Codeunder Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226or the inherent powers underSection 482of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. [xfed] (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. [xfed] (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers underSection 156(1)of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview ofSection 155(2)of the Code. [xfed] (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. [xfed] (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without any order of a Magistrate as contemplated underSection 155(2)of the Code. [xfed] (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that11there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. [xfed] (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisionsof the Codeor the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision inthe Codeor the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. [xfed] (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."" [xfed] 17. Thus, based on the discussions as above, in the light of the guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), I find that this case is a fit case and falls in Category (1) and (5) of the above guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. The entire criminal proceeding in Sector 4 Police Station Case No.86 of 2018, so far as it relates to the petitioner, abovenamed, is hereby quashed. All subsequent proceedings also stand quashed.

No. 2134 of 2020) while working as a Private Secretary to Sri Mrigendra Pratap Singh, the then Vidhan Sabha Speaker, Jharkhand during the period from August 2004 to December 2004 and subsequently to Sri Chandra Prakash Choudhary, the then Minister of Water Supply and Sanitation during the period 09.10.2006 to 23.08.2008 had in the name of Sri Manoj Singh (HUF) acquired assets worth Rs. 12,95,47,971/- which is disproportionate to his known sources of income. It has been alleged that Sri Manoj Singh had acquired proceeds of crime and placed the said proceeds of crime in the form of fixed deposit and other deposits. In the commission of the said offence, Sri Manoj Kumar Singh had been intentionally assisted by the other accused persons. [xfed] Based on the aforesaid allegation, a complaint case was lodged which was registered as ECIR/02/PAT/11/AD in which cognizance has been taken for the offences underSections 3and4of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. [xfed] The background facts prior to the institution of the complaint is-2-that on 15.10.2009 and 21.10.2009, searches were conducted by the Income Tax Department at Ranchi and in the village of Sri Manoj Kumar, in course of which there was a recovery of 169 fixed deposit receipts investing Rs. 12,54,45, 499/- with Uttar Pradesh Chhetriya Gramin Bank, Magarpal, Murtaza branch, Chhapra; 24 fixed deposits worth Rs. 12,75,000/- invested with United Bank of India, R. K. Mission Extension Counter, Morhabadi, Ranchi; Rs. 4,49,000/- in the savings bank account of Sri Manoj Kumar in United Bank of India, R. K. Mission Extension Counter, Morhabadi, Ranchi and Rs. 23,77,977 from the savings bank account of Sri Manoj Kumar from Uttar Pradesh Chhetriya Gramin Bank, Magarpal, Murtaza branch, Chhapra. [xfed] Pursuant to the search and seizure as indicated above, the Vigilance Bureau, Jharkhand had registered an FIR being Vigilance Case No. 23 of 2009. On completion of investigation, charge-sheet has been submitted only against Sri Manoj Kumar underSections 13(1) (E) read withSection 13(2) of thePrevention of Corruption ActandSections 467,468,469,471and420of I.P.C. and accordingly cognizance was also taken under the aforesaid provisions of law. The order taking cognizance was challenged by Sri Manoj Kumar Singh in Cr.M.P. No. 1913 of 2013 and vide order dated 07.03.2014, the order dated 16.04.2010 under which cognizance was taken underSections 467,468,469,471and420of I.P.C. was set aside. Pursuant to the charge-sheet submitted by the Vigilance Bureau, the Directorate of Enforcement had instituted the complaint case. [xfed] It has been stated by Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel for the petitioners that in B.A. No. 2134 of 2020 in the Vigilance Case, the petitioner had been granted bail by this Court in B. A. No. 4392 of 2010. He has referred to the order passed in Cr.M.P. No. 1913 of 2013 by which the cognizance order dated 16.04.2010 was set aside so far asSections 467,468,469,471and420I.P.C. are concerned. Learned counsel furthers his argument by stating that the petitioner has fully cooperated in investigation and documents in defence was also submitted. He has stated that the petitioner Manoj Kumar had given suitable explanation regarding his unsourced income. Reference has been made to the communication of the Circle Officer which categorises the agricultural income of the petitioner - Manoj Kumar. The agricultural income is-3-itself to the tune of Rs. one crore. Mr. Rajendra Krishna has further submitted that the gold and diamonds were purchased from the agricultural income from time immemorial. The gold and diamonds were taken to the Valuer Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni for the valuation and the cost of the gold and diamonds were assessed at Rs. 10 crores approximately. He has also drawn the attention of the Court to the statement of Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni recorded underSection 15of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, in which he has stated about the valuation done and the charges taken by him and which has been shown in the Income Tax return for the financial year 2005-06. It has been submitted that the petitioner has given suitable explanation about his income and it cannot be said that the income generated by the petitioner was from the proceeds of crime. Mr. Rajendra Krishna has also referred to the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" reported in 2020 (1) JBCJ 28 (SC) and has stated that the criteria laid down for grant of bail does not disentitle the petitioner to the same. He has further submitted that the petitioner is in custody since 15.02.2020 and no custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required. So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, learned counsel submits that the petitioners have been implicated for being the brothers of Manoj Kumar. In course of investigation, none of the witnesses have taken the name of these petitioners. It has been stated that both the petitioners are in custody since 28.02.2020. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also referred to a judgment in the case of ""Sanjay Chandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" reported in (2012) 1 SCC [xfed] 40. Mr. Amit Kumar Das and Mr. Prashant Vidyarthy, learned counsel for the Directorate of Enforcement have drawn the attention of the court to the investigation which came to the conclusion that Valuer had prepared the valuation report without physical verification, only for the purposes of pecuniary gain. While relying on the investigation, reference has been made to the purported sale of diamonds by the accused Manoj Kumar which were found to be false. He has also submitted that the agricultural income as shown by the accused Manoj Kumar, in view of the statement of some of the buyers has also been-4-falsified. Learned counsels also indicated about the conduct of the petitioners to the effect that they had only surrendered once processes underSections 82&83Cr.P.C. have been issued. It has been submitted that thePrevention of Corruption Actand thePrevention of Money Laundering Actoperate in different fields with respect to the factors guiding consideration of bail. Mr. Das has submitted that in the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram"" (supra), bail was granted on the parameters of the accused person being aged 74 years and was suffering from illness. In such circumstances, as noted above, a prayer has been made for rejecting the bail applications preferred by the petitioners. [xfed] In course of investigation by the Vigilance Bureau, it was detected that so far as the valuation of gold and diamonds are concerned, the jewellery was not physically taken to the Valuer, but instead the Valuer had given a back dated valuation report and in lieu thereof, he was given an amount of Rs. 1,26,042/-. Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni, the Valuer in his statement underSection 15of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has specifically stated about the valuation being made after the gold and diamonds were brought before him by the accused which is contrary to what has been stated by him before the Vigilance Bureau. In course of investigation, it has also come that the petitioner Manoj Kumar had submitted some invoices in support of his claim regarding sale of diamonds worth Rs. 8,17,21,664/- to one M/s. Star Traders, Mumbai/Surat which was a proprietorship firm of Raj Kumar Patodia. However, the income tax return does not indicate regarding the claim of Sri Manoj Kumar about the sale of diamonds as stated above. It has also come during course of investigation that the address of M/s. Star Traders has been given in the invoices submitted by Sri Manoj Kumar which is apparently false as there is no firm in existence in the name of M/s. Star Traders at Surat. In fact the son of Raj Kumar Patodia had denied being aware of any purchase of diamond or of the residential address of his father which had been provided by the petitioner - Manoj Kumar. In fact, with respect to the agricultural income for which reliance has been placed on various documents by the learned counsel for the petitioner, but in course of investigation, the statements of several persons who were said to have purchased the agricultural produce have stated-5-otherwise which also contradicts the claim of the petitioner - Manoj Kumar Singh regarding his explanation with respect to the income from agricultural produce. So far as the petitioner in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 is concerned, they appear to have been implicated being the brothers of the main accused - Sri Manoj Kumar. [xfed] At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer to some of the pronouncements which have been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners. In the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" (supra), it has been held with respect to the factors guiding consideration of bail as follows: [xfed] 22. ""The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on the basis of the well-settled principles having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. The following factors are to be taken into consideration while considering an application for bail:- (i) the nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the prosecution; (ii) reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses or apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; (iii) reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscondence; [xfed] (iv) character behaviour and standing of the accused and the circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; (v) larger interest of the public or the State and similar other considerations (videPrahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi(2001) 4 SCC 280). There is no hard and fast rule regarding grant or refusal to grant bail. Each case has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case and on its own merits. The discretion of the court has to be exercised judiciously and not in an arbitrary manner. At this stage itself, it is necessary for us to indicate that we are unable to accept the contention of the learned Solicitor General that ""flight risk"" of economic offenders should be looked at as a national phenomenon and be dealt with in that manner merely because certain other offenders have flown out of the country. The same cannot, in our view, be put in a straight-jacket formula so as to deny bail to the one who is before the Court, due to the conduct of other offenders, if the person under consideration is otherwise entitled to bail on the merits of his own case. Hence, in our view, such consideration including as to ""flight risk"" is to be made on individual basis being uninfluenced by the unconnected cases, more so, when the personal liberty is involved."" [xfed] In the case of ""Sanjay Chandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" (supra), it has been held as follows: [xfed] 21. ""In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the earliest times that the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it is required to-6-ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty. [xfed] 22. From the earliest times, it was appreciated that detention in custody pending completion of trial could be a cause of great hardship. From time to time, necessity demands that some unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases, ""necessity"" is the operative test. In this country, it would be quite contrary to the concept of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any person should be punished in respect of any matter, upon which, he has not been convicted or that in any circumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he will tamper with the witnesses if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary circumstances. [xfed] 23. Apart from the question of prevention being the object of refusal of bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any imprisonment before conviction has a substantial punitive content and it would be improper for any court to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of former conduct whether the accused has been convicted for it or not or to refuse bail to an unconvicted person for the purpose of giving him a taste of imprisonment as a lesson. [xfed] 24. In the instant case, we have already noticed that the ""pointing finger of accusation"" against the appellants is ""the seriousness of the charge"". The offences alleged are economic offences which have resulted in loss to the State exchequer. Though, they contend that there is a possibility of the appellants tampering with the witnesses, they have not placed any material in support of the allegation. In our view, seriousness of the charge is, no doubt, one of the relevant considerations while considering bail applications but that is not the only test or the factor: the other factor that also requires to be taken note of is the punishment that could be imposed after trial and conviction, both underthe Penal Codeand thePrevention of Corruption Act. Otherwise, if the former is the only test, we would not be balancing the constitutional rights but rather ""recalibrating the scales of justice"". [xfed] 25. The provisions ofCrPCconfer discretionary jurisdiction on criminal courts to grant bail to the accused pending trial or in appeal against convictions; since the jurisdiction is discretionary, it has to be exercised with great care and caution by balancing the valuable right of liberty of an individual and the interest of the society in general. In our view, the reasoning adopted by the learned District Judge, which is affirmed by the High Court, in our opinion, is a denial of the whole basis of our system of law and normal rule of bail system. It transcends respect for the requirement that a man shall be considered innocent until he is found guilty. If such power is recognised, then it may lead to-7-chaotic situation and would jeopardise the personal liberty of an individual."" [xfed] As has been noted in the present case, the entire allegations appear to be centered around the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020. So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, there does not appear to be any specific allegation levelled against them and they being the brothers of main accused - Sri Manoj Kumar have been proceeded against in the case of money laundering. All the petitioners are in custody since 28.02.2020 and at the present juncture, no custodial interrogation is necessary. It further appears that the precursor to the investigation carried out by the Directorate of Enforcement appears to be the case instituted by the Vigilance Bureau in which the said Manoj Kumar @ Manoj Kumar Singh has been granted bail in B. A. No. 4392 of 2010. Judgments referred to above have categorically underlined the principle that the ultimate consideration in a case of bail will have to be a case to case basis on the facts involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand trial. [xfed] An economic offence is a grave offence and considering the role played by the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020 in which he had misused his position of being the Private Secretary of the then Speaker as well as the then Minister while amassing a huge wealth which is disproportionate to his known source of income and having miserably failed to submit any appropriate explanation for such income from the proceeds of crime, I am not inclined to grant bail to him. The prayer for bail of the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020 is hereby rejected. [xfed] So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, I am inclined to grant bail to the said petitioners. [xfed] Accordingly, the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 above named are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Additional Judicial Commissioner I cum Special Judge, PMLA, Ranchi in connection with ECIR/02/PAT/11/AD.

Respondents [xfed] -------- [xfed] PRESENT : [xfed] Heard Miss. Amrita Vijay, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mrs. Vandana Singh, the learned Sr. SC-III appearing for the2respondent State. [xfed] 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. [xfed] 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order contained in Memo No.727 dated 04.02.2019 [Annexure-6] issued by the respondent no.2 whereby the petitioner has been inflicted punishment of withholding the petitioner's three consecutive pay increment with non-cumulative effect and also punishment of censure. [xfed] 4. The case of the petitioner in this writ petition is that in the year 2008 the petitioner was Junior Engineer, working in Minor Irrigation Division, Godda under Water Resources Department, Jharkhand. The respondent no.3, the DC-cum-DPC entrusted 311 MGNREGA works to respondent no.5, the Executive Engineer and also released funds from contingency head of the MGNREGA scheme for purchase of agricultural tools and implements for distrubution amongst farmers/labourers for implementation of MGNREGA works. In the financial year 2008-09, the DC-cum-DPC released contintency funds to the Executive Engineer, M.I. Division, Godda in two trenches. Subsequently, the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5 advanced a sum of Rs.1,09,890/- to the petitioner. The petitioner purchased tools and implements from the open market and distrubuted amongst the farmers/labourers through their beneficiary committee. The petitioner3submitted their accounts to the respondent no.5 Executive Engineer through Assistant Engineer, who in his turn passed the vouchers and booked under the contingency head of MGNREGA funds from which advance had been released by the DC-cum-DPC. Thereafter the issue of Head of expenditure and violation of Rules 235 and 241 of the Bihar Finance Rule was raised by the respondent no.4 which culminated in the departmental enquiry. The enquiry report was submitted in which enquiry report rules out any financial loss or even temporary embezzlement as reflected in the equiry report [Annexure- 2] and the impugned order of punishment has been passed. [xfed] 5. The case of the respondent-State is that the petitoner has purchased agricultural tools and implements it for various labour cooperation societies /committees of beneficiaries to the farmers under the scheme of MNREGA. As per the letter of National level Monitor the tools and implements are to be supplied to the labours free of cost and should be purchased through the material head but the then Executive Engineer allotted the amount to the Junior Engineers from contingency fund and there is no provision to purchase the tools and implements from the contingency fund. For the alleged irregularity in the MNREGA scheme and for the misappropriation of public fund by the petitioner during the posting at Minor Irrigation Subdivision, Godda, the Deputy Commissioner, Godda vide letter dated 21.08.2012 proposed prapatra ""ka"" for the departmenal proceeding. Accordingly, departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930. The enquiry officer4found him guilty of two charges and so far as other charges are concerned, he has been exonerated and submitted a report. The petitioner was asked to file reply to the second show cause, the reply of the second show cause was not satisfactory. The petitioner was provided the fund in the year 2009 but he deposited the same in the year 2011 hence, a case of temporary embezzlement of money is made out against the petitioner and that is why the punishment order has been passed. [xfed] 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner has also deposited the amount in question, there is no question of any embezzlement, what to say about temporary embezzlement. She submitted that the funds were properly utilized for implementation of MGNREGA scheme. The respondent no.4 resorted to the pressure tactics and compelled the Junior Engineers to refund the sanctioned amount which was advanced to them by the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5. After more than a year, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner. She submitted that the amount in qustion has already been deposited, thus, there is no embezzlement. The enquiry officer finally submitted the enquiry report and he found that there is no case of embezzlement, but a case of procedural mistake on the part of the petitioner may be there. She further submitted that when the enquiry officer has already exonerated the petitioner, the respondent was bound to follow the procedure prescribed in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" reported in (1998) 7 SCC 84. She further relied in the case of5""Md. Noorul Hoda v. The State of Jharkhand and Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2201 of 2019] rendered by a coordinate Bench of this Court and submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in the light of the judgment of a coordinate Bench. She further relied in the case of ""Satish Sharma v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2357 of 2019]. By way of referring to these two judegments, she further submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the coordinate Bench judgments (supra). [xfed] 7. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent State submitted that the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. She further submitted that so far these two cases of coordinate Benches are concerned, are passed on the basis of Rule 43(b) of Jharkhand Pension Rules, whereas in the present case, the petitioner is working and in that view of the matter, that judgments are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. She further submitted that there is financial embezzlement and that is why there is no illegality in the punishment order. Mrs. Vandana Singh, the learned State counsel relied in the case of ""State of M eghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580, at page 583. Paragraph no.14 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow : [xfed] 14. In the matter of imposition of sentence, the scope for interference is very limited and restricted to exceptional cases. The jurisdiction of the High Court, to interfere with the quantum of punishment is limited and cannot be exercised without sufficient reasons. The High Court, although has jurisdiction in appropriate case, to consider the question in regard to the quantum of punishment, but it has a limited role6to play. It is now well settled that the High Courts, in exercise of powers underArticle 226, do not interfere with the quantum of punishment unless there exist sufficient reasons therefor. The punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority unless shocking to the conscience of the court, cannot be subjected to judicial review. In the impugned order of the High Court no reasons whatsoever have been indicated as to why the punishment was considered disproportionate. Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. The mere statement that it is disproportionate would not suffice. [xfed] 8. The Court has proceeded to examine the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties. The Court has perused the enquiry report wherein it is transpired that the enquiry officer has come to the conclusion that there is no case of embezzlement of Government fund is made out against the petitioner. However, the procedural lacuna has been indicated in the enquiry report by the petitioner. The cases relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case as in those cases, the Hon'ble Bench has passed the order on the strength of Rule 43 (b) of the Jharkhand Pension Rules as in that case the petitioner was retired person and claiming for his pension and the said order was passed and in the present case, the petitioners are in service thus, those cases are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. So far as the case rendered in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" (supra) is concerned that is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and there is no complete exoneration by the enquiry officer in view of the fact other procedural part is concerned. The second show cause has also been issued to the7petitioner and the petitioner has complied and after that the disciplinary authority has passed the order. It is well-settled provision of law that loss of confidence is primary factor, not the amount of money misappropriated. A temporary embezzlement is also a misconduct. Reference in this regard may be made in ""Diwanj Singh v. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Ors."" reported in (2015) 2 SCC 341. Paragraph no.8, 9 and 10 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow : [xfed] ""8. As far as argument relating to quantum of punishment, as modified by the High Court, which results in consequential forfeiture of pensionary benefits in view of Rule 23, quoted above, is concerned, we do not find the punishment to be harsh or disproportionate to the guilt, in view of the nature of the charge of which the appellant is found guilty in the present case. Time and again, this Court has consistently held that in such matters no sympathy should be shown by the courts. [xfed] 9. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh, this Court, in para 18 of the judgment has expressed the views on this point as under: [xfed] ""18. In the instant case, the misappropriation of the funds by the delinquent employee was only Rs 360.95. This Court has considered the punishment that may be awarded to the delinquent employees who misappropriated the funds of the Corporation and the factors to be considered. This Court in a catena of judgments held that the loss of confidence is the primary factor and not the amount of money misappropriated and that the sympathy or generosity cannot be a factor which is impermissible in law. When an employee is found guilty of pilferage or of misappropriating the Corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the Corporation losing confidence or faith in such an employee and awarding punishment of dismissal. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or misplaced sympathy on the part of the judicial forums and interfering therefore with the quantum of punishment."" [xfed] 10.In Karnataka SRTC v. A.T. Mane4in which unaccounted amount was only Rs 93 this Court expressed its opinion in para 12 as under: (SCC p. 259) ""12. Coming to the question of quantum of punishment, one should bear in mind the fact that it is not the amount of money misappropriated that becomes a primary factor for awarding punishment; on the contrary, it is the loss of confidence which is the primary factor to be taken into consideration. In our opinion, when a person is found guilty of misappropriating the corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the corporation losing confidence or faith in such a person and awarding a punishment of dismissal."" [xfed] 9. So far as the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the respondent in the case of ""State of Meghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580 is concerned, the Court is in agreement that the Court generally did not interfere underArticle 226of the Constitution of India if the punishment is on the well-founded basis, but in this case two punishments have been passed, which shocks the conscience of the Court.In view of settled legal proposition that the disciplinary authority on the basis of the magnitude of the misconduct is empowered to impose the punishment appropriate to the situation. The amount has already been deposited. [xfed] 10. Thus the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable to the Court. The Court further finds that for such punishment, the petitioner has been punished with two punishments i.e. Withholding of three consequtive pay increments with non- cumulative effect and also of censure, which shocks the conscience of the Court and on the quantum of punishment, the writ petition9succeeds and accordingly, the impugned order dated 04.02.2019 is quashed. [xfed] 11. The matter is remitted back to the respondent State to pass a fresh order in the light of the observation made in this judgment. [xfed] 12. The writ petition [W.P.(S) No.5798 of 2019] stands allowed to the above extent and disposed of. [xfed] ( Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi, J) High Court of Jharkhand, Dated : 02/09/2020 NAFR, SI,"

Mazumdar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned A.P.P. for the State. [xfed] The petitioner is an accused in connection with Bariyatu P.S. Case No. 123 of 2020. [xfed] The prosecution story in brief is that the petitioner and the informant had duty in the Covid-ICU from 21.05.2020, according to the Covid-ICU roster. During this period the informant was staying in the paying ward in Room No. D-19 on the fourth floor, which was allotted to her. The petitioner was staying at his own residence. On 27.05.2020 one patient namely Guddu Mahli had to be incubated and put on ventilator support. This led to activation of Covid-ICU at 5:30 A.M. on 27.05.2020. As the patient was a suspect of Covid-19 he had to be kept in Covid-ICU till the test report came. The informant as well as the petitioner had to look after the patient till the replacements arrived at 9:30 A.M. on 28.05.2020. Subsequently it was informed that the patient's Covid test report was 'Negative'. Since the report was negative a decision was made to shift the patient to critical care ICU which is temporarily running in the Cardiology Block. It has been alleged that after the shifting was initiated, the petitioner told the informant that his residence will be closed for the night and that the Guard at his residence was not picking his call as such the petitioner insisted to stay in the paying ward with the informant in the same room which was-2-allotted to her. Since the aforesaid proposal was not acceptable to the informant she had somehow managed to get allotted Room No. D-15 to the petitioner. It has also been alleged that the petitioner called the informant on phone and came into her room and asked her to show his room. Further allegation has been levelled that when the informant showed the petitioner his room, the petitioner asked her to provide a bottle of water and when the informant went to hand him over the same the petitioner is said to have outraged her modesty and molested her but the informant somehow managed to escape from his clutches and informed her seniors which ultimately led to institution of the First Information Report. [xfed] It has been stated by Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is a Doctor by profession and is working at present as a Senior Resident in (PDCC, Critical Care) in the Trauma Department of RIMS, Ranchi since 05.08.2019. Learned senior counsel submits that in the wake of the pandemic the petitioner was directed to work in the Covid-19 team from 21.05.2020 to 27.05.2020 along with the informant. Learned senior counsel submits that no such incident as alleged had taken place and in fact the informant in order to settle scores on account of her leaving Medica Super Speciality Hospital where she was working under the father-in-law of the petitioner the present criminal case has been instituted. Mr. Mazumdar, further submits that there has been a considerable delay in institution of the First Information Report as the occurrence is said to have taken place in the night of 27/28.05.2020 but the complaint was lodged on 28.05.2020 at about 8:00 P.M. While referring to the statement of the informant recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C., Mr. Mazumdar, further submits that on the face of it the same at best appears to be a case u/s 354Aof the Indian Penal Codewhich is bailable in nature. It has further been stated that the 164Cr.P.C. statement which was taken after two days of the alleged incident is an exaggerated-3-account on the part of the informant. It has been stated that the petitioner has remained in custody since 02.06.2020 and on the facts narrated above the petitioner deserves to be released on bail. [xfed] Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned A.P.P. for the State has opposed the prayer for bail made by the petitioner. He has stated that the First Information Report as well as the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim would indicate that the petitioner was persistently making requests to stay the night with the informant. He has further submitted that the offence as alleged does not come within the purview ofSection 354Aof the Indian Penal Code since the petitioner had repeatedly made attempts at molesting the informant when she had come to the room allotted to the petitioner. [xfed] On consideration of the arguments advanced by the learned counsels for the petitioner as well as the learned A.P.P. for the State the First Information Report as well as the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the informant has been looked into. The 164Cr.P.C. statement basically is a reiteration of the written report submitted by the informant. It further appears from the said statement that details have been given regarding the duty which was allotted to the petitioner and the informant and the repeated insistence on the part of the petitioner to stay with the informant for the night on the excuse that it was not possible for the petitioner to go back to his residence. The various circumstances have been enumerated in the 164Cr.P.C. statement and lastly it has been stated at paragraph 11 of the said statement that when the informant progressed towards the door for going to her house the petitioner had caught her hand and tried to drag her thrice towards him and had also switched off the light. The petitioner has also been alleged to have pushed her towards the bed and had climbed upon her and when the informant started crying the grip of the petitioner loosened and the informant managed to escape and thereafter informed her seniors. She has further disclosed that the-4-petitioner had sent her a message on WhatsApp apologizing for such act on his part. [xfed] The gamut of the allegations levelled do not indicate an offence u/s 354Aof the Indian Penal Codeas has much been stressed upon by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner. The act of the petitioner was explicit as the petitioner had dragged the informant towards the bed and had climbed atop her but the informant somehow managed to escape from his clutches and the intention of the petitioner in the entire background facts and circumstances of the case as narrated by the informant does indicate an attempt made by the petitioner to commit rape upon the informant. [xfed] In such fact situation, therefore, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner. The same is hereby rejected at this stage. [xfed] (R. Mukhopadhyay, J.) Alok/-"

Respondents [xfed] -------- [xfed] PRESENT : [xfed] Heard Miss Amrita Vijay, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Ashish Shekhar, the learned AC to SC(L&C)-II appearing for the respondent State. [xfed] [xfed] 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. [xfed] 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order contained in Memo No.727 dated 04.02.2019 [Annexure-6] issued by the respondent no.2 whereby the petitioner has been inflicted punishment of withholding the petitioner's three consecutive pay increment with non-cumulative effect and also punishment of censure. [xfed] 4. The case of the petitioner in this writ petition is that in the year 2008 the petitioner was Junior Engineer, working in Minor Irrigation Division, Godda under Water Resources Department, Jharkhand. The respondent no.3, the DC-cum-DPC entrusted 311 MGNREGA works to respondent no.5, the Executive Engineer and also released funds from contingency head of the MGNREGA scheme for purchase of agricultural tools and implements for distrubution amongst farmers/labourers for implementation of MGNREGA works. In the financial year 2008-09, the DC-cum-DPC released contintency funds to the Executive Engineer, M.I. Division, Godda in two trenches. Subsequently, the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5 advanced a sum of Rs.2,41,850/- to the petitioner. The petitioner purchased tools and implements from the open market and distrubuted amongst the farmers/labourers through their beneficiary committee. The petitioner submitted their accounts to the respondent no.5 Executive Engineer through Assistant Engineer, who in his turn passed the vouchers and3booked under the contingency head of MGNREGA funds from which advance had been released by the DC-cum-DPC. Thereafter the issue of Head of expenditure and violation of Rules 235 and 241 of the Bihar Finance Rule was raised by the respondent no.4 which culminated in the departmental enquiry. The enquiry report was submitted in which enquiry report rules out any financial loss or even temporary embezzlement as reflected in the enquiry report [Annexure-2] and the impugned order of punishment has been passed. [xfed] 5. The case of the respondent-State is that the petitoner has purchased agricultural tools and implements it for various labour cooperation societies /committees of beneficiaries to the farmers under the scheme of MNREGA. As per the letter of Na tional level Monitor the tools and implements are to be s upplied to the labours free of cost and should be purchased through the material head but the then Executive Engineer allotted the amount to the Junior Engineers from contintency fund and there is no provision to purchase the tools and implements from the contingency fund. For the alleged irregularity in the MNREGA scheme and for the misappropriation of public fund by the petitioner during the posting at Minor Irrigation Subdivision, Godda, the Deputy Commissioner, Godda vide letter dated 21.08.2012 proposed prapatra ""ka"" for the departmenal proceeding. Accordingly, departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930. The enquiry officer found him guilty of two charges and so far as other charges are concerned, he has been exonerated and submitted a report. The petitioner was asked to file reply to the second show cause, the second4show cause was not satisfactory. The petitioner was provided the fund in the year 2009 but he deposited the same in the year 2011 hence, a case of temporary embezzlement of money is made out against the petitioner and that is why the punishment order has been passed. [xfed] 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner has also deposited the amount in question, there is no question of any embezzlement, what to say about temporary embezzlement. She submitted that the funds were properly utilized for implementation of MGNREGA scheme. The respondent no.4 resorted to the pressure tactics and compelled the Junior Engineers to refund the sanctioned amount which was advanced to them by the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5. After more than a year, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner. She submitted that the amount in qustion has already been deposited, thus, there is no embezzlement. The enquiry officer finally submitted the enquiry report and he found that there is no case of embezzlement, but a case of procedural mistake on the part of the petitioner may be there. She further submitted that when the enquiry officer has already exonerated the petitioner, the respondent was bound to follow the procedure prescribed in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" reported in (1998) 7 SCC 84. She further relied in the case of ""Md. Noorul Hoda v. The State of Jharkhand and Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2201 of 2019] rendered by a coordinate Bench of this Court and submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in the light of the judgment of a coordinate Bench. She further relied in the case of ""Satish Sharma v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2357 of52019]. By way of referring to these two judegments, she further submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the coordinate Bench judgments (supra). [xfed] 7. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent State submitted that the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. He further submitted that so far these two cases of coordinate Benches are concerned, are passed on the basis of Rule 43(b) of Jharkhand Pension Rules, whereas in the present case, the petitioner is workijng and in that view of the matter, that judgment are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. He further submitted that there is financial embezzlement and that is why there is no illegality in the punishment order. [xfed] 8. The Court has proceeded to examine the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties. The Court has perused the enquiry report wherein it is transpired that the enquiry officer has come to the conclusion that there is no case of embezzlement of Government fund is made out against the petitioner. However, the procedural lacuna has been indicated in the enquiry report by the petitioner. The cases relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case as in those cases, the Hon'ble Bench has passed the order on the strength of Rule 43(b) of the Jharkhand Pension Rules as in that case the petitioner was a retired person and claiming for his pension and the said order was passed and in the present case, the petitioners are in servi ce thus, those cases are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. So6far as the case rendered in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" (supra) is concerned that is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and there is no complete exoneration by the enquiry officer in view of other procedural part is concerned. The second show cause has also been issued to the petitioner and the petitioner has complied and after that the disciplinary authority has passed the order. It is well-settled provision of law that loss of confidence is primary factor, not the amount of money misappropriated. A temporary embezzlement is also a misconduct. Reference in this regard may be made in ""Diwanj Singh v. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Ors."" reported in (2015) 2 SCC 341. Paragraph no.8, 9 and 10 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow : [xfed] ""8. As far as argument relating to quantum of punishment, as modified by the High Court, which results in consequential forfeiture of pensionary benefits in view of Rule 23, quoted above, is concerned, we do not find the punishment to be harsh or disproportionate to the guilt, in view of the nature of the charge of which the appellant is found guilty in the present case. Time and again, this Court has consistently held that in such matters no sympathy should be shown by the courts. [xfed] 9. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh, this Court, in para 18 of the judgment has expressed the views on this point as under: [xfed] ""18. In the instant case, the misappropriation of the funds by the delinquent employee was only Rs 360.95. This Court has considered the punishment that may be awarded to the delinquent employees who misappropriated the funds of the Corporation and the factors to be considered. This Court in a catena of judgments held that the loss of confidence is the primary factor and not the amount of money misappropriated and that the sympathy or generosity cannot be a factor which is impermissible in law. When an employee is found guilty of pilferage or of7misappropriating the Corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the Corporation losing confidence or faith in such an employee and awarding punishment of dismissal. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or misplaced sympathy on the part of the judicial forums and interfering therefore with the quantum of punishment."" [xfed] 10.In Karnataka SRTC v. A.T. Mane4in which unaccounted amount was only Rs 93 this Court expressed its opinion in para 12 as under: (SCC p. 259) ""12. Coming to the question of quantum of punishment, one should bear in mind the fact that it is not the amount of money misappropriated that becomes a primary factor for awarding punishment; on the contrary, it is the loss of confidence which is the primary factor to be taken into consideration. In our opinion, when a person is found guilty of misappropriating the corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the corporation losing confidence or faith in such a person and awarding a punishment of dismissal."" [xfed] 9. So far as the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the respondent in the case of ""State of Meghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580 is concerned, the Court is in agreement that the Court generally did not interfere underArticle 226of the Constitution of India if the punishment is on the well-founded basis, but in this case two punishments have been passed, which shocks the conscience of the Court. In view of settled legal proposition that the disciplinary authority on the basis of the magnitude of the misconduct is empowered to impose the punishment appropriate to the situation. The amount in question has already been deposited. [xfed] 10. Thus the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable to the Court. The Court further finds that for such8punishment, the petitioner has been punished with two punishments i.e. Withholding of three consequtive pay increments with non- cumulative effect and also of censure, which shocks the conscience of the Court and on the quantum of punishment, the writ petition succeeds and accordingly, the impugned order dated 04.02.2019 is quashed. [xfed] 11. The matter is remitted back to the respondent State to pass a fresh order in the light of the observation made in this judgment. [xfed] 12. The writ petition [W.P.(S) No.5762 of 2019] stands allowed to the above extent and disposed of. [xfed] ( Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi, J) High Court of Jharkhand, Dated : 02/09/2020 NAFR, SI,"

No.29 of 2019, pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi. [xfed] Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is guarantor of loan (cash credit facility) taken from the respondent no.3 (Dena Bank, Jamshedpur Branch) by the respondent no.4 in the year 2012. Subsequently, the said loan account became non-performing asset (NPA) on 31st January, 2018. Accordingly, a notice was issued by the respondent no.3 to the respondent no.4 underSection 13(2)of the Act, 2002 for payment of outstanding dues. Thereafter, a notice dated 28th September, 2018 for sale of immovable property of the petitioner was issued by the respondent no.3 under rules 8(6) and 9(1) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 to the borrower- respondent no.4 as well as the petitioner being the guarantor. Aggrieved by the said notice, the petitioner preferred an application-2-before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi underSection 17(1)of the Act, 2002, which was registered as S.A. No.29 of 2019. Since the date of institution of the said application before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi, no effective step has been taken by the said Tribunal. In the meantime, a notice underSection 13(4)(a)of the Act, 2002 has been issued by the respondent no.3 on 3rd March, 2020 (Annexure-5 to the writ petition). Since S.A. No.29 of 2019 is not being taken up by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi, the petitioner has been compelled to file the present writ petition. [xfed] Having heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the fact that the petitioner has already moved the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi by filing an application underSection 17(1)of the Act, 2002, which has also been registered as S.A. no.29 of 2019, without entering into the merit of the case, the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi is directed to expedite the hearing of the said case and to pass an appropriate order in accordance with law expeditiously.

Further prayer has been made for issuance of direction upon the respondent no.3 to take decision on the representation filed by the petitioner on 13 th November, 2019 as well as legal notices dated 7th September, 2019 and 23rd September, 2019 by which the petitioner has made request to make payment of the said amount to him in consequence of Award no.516 dated 9th September, 2017.

[xfed] The grievance of the petitioner is that despite preparation of the award in his favour, the compensation amount for acquisition of the aforesaid land for widening of N.H.2 has not been paid to him. On perusal of the petitioner's representation submitted before the-2-respondent no.3, it appears that one Ganga Rani, wife of Jodho Ram has filed an objection in relation to the said award, which, according to the petitioner, has been made without any basis only to delay the payment of compensation to the petitioner. [xfed] Considering the fact that there is a counter claim in relation to the award in question and the matter requires factual determination, the respondent no.3 (competent authority) is directed to take appropriate decision underSection 3H(3)of the National Highways Act, 1956 with regard to entitlement for receiving the compensation amount.

[xfed] 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a dental college and hospital in which prescribed course schedule has been provided by the University Grants Commission, Dental Council of India and a notice has been issued on 21st June, 2020 to undertake registration of MDS courses and PG Diploma courses in the current year. The regular academic session for the year 2020-21 has already commenced. The admission has been taken and the college is working in full capacity employing all its human resources (teaching and non-teaching). The-2-grievance of the petitioner is that the respondent no.3 while issuing the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020 exercising his power underSection 65of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and by adopting pick and choose method, the building with its campus, human resources, furniture, lavatory premises, generator and all other available facilities in the petitioner-college have been directed to be acquired from the date of use. Since the petitioner is undertaking all the academic activities in terms of the guidelines/advisory of Dental Council of India, the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020, so far as the same relates to the petitioner is arbitrary and discriminatory. The petitioner has already submitted its representation on 29th July, 2020 (Annexure-11 to the writ petition) before the respondent no.3 explaining its difficulties in detail. However, no decision has been taken by the said authority as yet. [xfed] 5. Learned A.C. to Additional Advocate General-II appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that considering the present situation prevailing due to outbreak of Corona (COVID-19) pandemic, the respondent no.3 while exercising his power underSection 65of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 has issued the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020 in relation to the petitioner-college, Kerala Samajam Model School, Golmuri and Kerala Public School, Mango and there is no legal infirmity in issuing the same. However, if the petitioner's representation dated 29th July, 2020 has not yet been decided by the respondent no.3, the same shall be decided and disposed of expeditiously. [xfed] 6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view that the petitioner has raised certain factual issues showing its difficulty with respect to converting the college and hospital premises as COVID-19 Care Center as well as that it has also raised an issue of discrimination while issuing the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020, without entering into the merit of the case, the respondent no.3 is directed to take an informed decision on the representation dated 29th July, 2020 (unless already disposed of) filed by the petitioner within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.
